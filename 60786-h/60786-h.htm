    FIRST PERIOD OF THE REIGN OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT — SIEGE
    AND CAPTURE OF&nbsp;THEBES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">My</span> last preceding volume
ended with the assassination of Philip of Macedon, and the accession
of his son Alexander the Great, then twenty years of age.</p>

<p>It demonstrates the altered complexion of Grecian history, that
we are now obliged to seek for marking events in the succession to
the Macedonian crown, or in the ordinances of Macedonian kings. In
fact, the Hellenic world has ceased to be autonomous. In Sicily,
indeed, the free and constitutional march, revived by Timoleon,
is still destined to continue for a few years longer; but all the
Grecian cities south of Mount Olympus have descended into dependents
of Macedonia. Such dependence, established as a fact by the battle
of Chæroneia and by the subsequent victorious march of Philip over
Peloponnesus, was acknowledged in form by the vote of the Grecian
synod at Corinth. While even the Athenians had been compelled to
concur in submission, Sparta alone, braving all consequences,
continued inflexible in her refusal. The adherence of Thebes was not
trusted to the word of the Thebans, but ensured by the Macedonian
garrison established in her citadel, called the Kadmeia. Each
Hellenic city, small and great,—maritime, inland, and insular—(with
the single exception of Sparta), was thus enrolled as a separate unit
in the list of subject-allies attached to the imperial headship of
Philip.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, the history of conquered Greece<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span> loses its separate course,
and becomes merged in that of conquering Macedonia. Nevertheless,
there are particular reasons which constrain the historian of Greece
to carry on the two together for a few years longer. First, conquered
Greece exercised a powerful action on her conqueror—“Græcia capta
ferum victorem cepit”. The Macedonians, though speaking a language
of their own, had neither language for communicating with others,
nor literature, nor philosophy, except Grecian and derived from
Greeks. Philip, while causing himself to be chosen chief of Hellas,
was himself not only partially hellenized, but an eager candidate
for Hellenic admiration. He demanded the headship under the declared
pretence of satisfying the old antipathy against Persia. Next, the
conquests of Alexander, though essentially Macedonian, operated
indirectly as the initiatory step of a series of events, diffusing
Hellenic language (with some tinge of Hellenic literature) over
a large breadth of Asia,—opening that territory to the better
observation, in some degree even to the superintendence, of
intelligent Greeks—and thus producing consequences important in many
ways to the history of mankind. Lastly, the generation of free Greeks
upon whom the battle of Chæroneia fell, were not disposed to lie
quiet if any opportunity occurred for shaking off their Macedonian
masters. The present volume will record the unavailing efforts made
for this purpose, in which Demosthenes and most of the other leaders
perished.</p>

<p>Alexander (born in July 356 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), like
his father Philip, was not a Greek, but a Macedonian and Epirot,
partially imbued with Grecian sentiment and intelligence. It is true
that his ancestors, some centuries before, had been emigrants from
Argos; but the kings of Macedonia had long lost all trace of any
such peculiarity as might originally have distinguished them from
their subjects. The basis of Philip’s character was Macedonian, not
Greek: it was the self-will of a barbarian prince, not the <i>ingenium
civile</i>, or sense of reciprocal obligation and right in society with
others, which marked more or less even the most powerful members of
a Grecian city, whether oligarchical or democratical. If this was
true of Philip, it was still more true of Alexander, who inherited
the violent temperament and headstrong will of his furious Epirotic
mother Olympias.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span>A kinsman of
Olympias, named Leonidas, and an Akarnanian named Lysimachus,
are mentioned as the chief tutors to whom Alexander’s
childhood was entrusted.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Of course the Iliad of Homer was among
the first things which he learnt as a boy. Throughout most of his
life, he retained a passionate interest in this poem, a copy of
which, said to have been corrected by Aristotle, he carried with
him in his military campaigns. We are not told, nor is it probable,
that he felt any similar attachment for the less warlike Odyssey.
Even as a child, he learnt to identify himself in sympathy with
Achilles,—his ancestor by the mother’s side, according to the Æakid
pedigree. The tutor Lysimachus won his heart by calling himself
Phœnix—Alexander, Achilles—and Philip, by the name of Peleus. Of
Alexander’s boyish poetical recitations, one anecdote remains, both
curious and of unquestionable authenticity. He was ten years old,
when the Athenian legation, including both Æschines and Demosthenes,
came to Pella to treat about peace. While Philip entertained them at
table, in his usual agreeable and convivial manner, the boy Alexander
recited for their amusement certain passages of poetry which he had
learnt—and delivered, in response with another boy, a dialogue out
of one of the Grecian dramas.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>At the age of thirteen, Alexander was placed under the instruction
of Aristotle, whom Philip expressly invited for the purpose, and
whose father Nikomachus had been both friend and physician of
Philip’s father Amyntas. What course of study Alexander was made to
go through, we unfortunately cannot state. He enjoyed the teaching of
Aristotle for at least three years, and we are told that he devoted
himself to it with ardor, contracting a strong attachment to his
preceptor. His powers of addressing an audience, though not so well
attested as those of his father, were always found sufficient for his
purpose: moreover, he retained, even in the midst of his fatiguing
Asiatic campaigns, an interest in Greek literature and poetry.</p>

<p>At what precise moment, during the lifetime of his father,
Alexander first took part in active service, we do not know.
It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> is said that
once, when quite a youth, he received some Persian envoys during
the absence of his father; and that he surprised them by the
maturity of his demeanor, as well as by the political bearing and
pertinence of his questions.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Though only sixteen years of age, in 340
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, he was left at home as regent
while Philip was engaged in the sieges of Byzantium and Perinthus.
He put down a revolt of the neighboring Thracian tribe called Mædi,
took one of their towns, and founded it anew under the title of
Alexandria; the earliest town which bore that name, afterwards
applied to so many other towns planted by him. In the march of
Philip into Greece (338 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
Alexander took part, commanded one of the wings at the battle of
Chæroneia, and is said to have first gained the advantage on his side
over the Theban sacred band.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding such marks of confidence and coöperation,
other incidents occurred producing bitter animosity between the
father and the son. By his wife Olympias, Philip had as offspring
Alexander and Kleopatra: by a Thessalian mistress named Philinna, he
had a son named Aridæus (afterwards called Philip Aridæus:) he had
also daughters named Kynna (or Kynanê) and Thessalonikê. Olympias,
a woman of sanguinary and implacable disposition, had rendered
herself so odious to him, that he repudiated her, and married a new
wife named Kleopatra. I have recounted in the preceding volume<a
id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the
indignation felt by Alexander at this proceeding, and the violent
altercation which occurred during the conviviality of the marriage
banquet; where Philip actually snatched his sword, threatened his
son’s life, and was only prevented from executing the threat by
falling down through intoxication. After this quarrel, Alexander
retired from Macedonia, conducting his mother to her brother
Alexander king of Epirus. A son was born to Philip by Kleopatra.
Her brother or uncle Attalus acquired high favor. Her kinsmen
and partisans generally were also pro<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span>moted, while Ptolemy, Nearchus, and other
persons attached to Alexander, were banished.<a id="FNanchor_6"
href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The prospects of Alexander were thus full of uncertainty and
peril, up to the very day of Philip’s assassination. The succession
to the Macedonian crown, though transmitted in the same family,
was by no means assured as to individual members; moreover, in
the regal house of Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> (as among the kings called Diadochi, who
acquired dominion after the death of Alexander the Great), violent
feuds and standing mistrust between father, sons, and brethren, were
ordinary phænomena, to which the family of the Antigonids formed an
honorable exception. Between Alexander and Olympias on the one side,
and Kleopatra with her son and Attalus on the other, a murderous
contest was sure to arise. Kleopatra was at this time in the
ascendent; Olympias was violent and mischievous; and Philip was only
forty-seven years of age. Hence the future threatened nothing<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span> but aggravated
dissension and difficulties for Alexander. Moreover his strong
will and imperious temper, eminently suitable for supreme command,
disqualified him from playing a subordinate part, even to his own
father. The prudence of Philip, when about to depart on his Asiatic
expedition, induced him to attempt to heal these family dissensions
by giving his daughter Kleopatra in marriage to her uncle Alexander
of Epirus, brother of Olympias. It was during the splendid marriage
festival, then celebrated at Ægæ, that he was assassinated—Olympias,
Kleopatra, and Alexander, being all present, while Attalus was in
Asia, commanding the Macedonian division sent forward in advance,
jointly with Parmenio. Had Philip escaped this catastrophe, he
would doubtless have carried on the war in Asia Minor with quite as
much energy and skill as it was afterwards prosecuted by Alexander:
though we may doubt whether the father would have stretched out to
those ulterior undertakings which, gigantic and far-reaching as
they were, fell short of the insatiable ambition of the son. But
successful as Philip might have been in Asia, he would hardly have
escaped gloomy family feuds; with Alexander as a mutinous son, under
the instigations of Olympias,—and with Kleopatra on the other side,
feeling that her own safety depended upon the removal of regal or
quasi-regal competitors.</p>

<p>From such formidable perils, visible in the distance, if not
immediately impending, the sword of Pausanias guaranteed both
Alexander and the Macedonian kingdom. But at the moment when the
blow was struck, and when the Lynkestian Alexander, one of those
privy to it, ran to forestall resistance and place the crown on the
head of Alexander the Great<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a>—no one knew what to expect from the
young prince thus suddenly exalted at the age of twenty years.
The sudden death of Philip in the fulness of glory and ambitious
hopes, must have produced the strongest impression, first upon the
festive crowd assembled,—next throughout Macedonia,—lastly, upon
the foreigners whom he had reduced to dependence, from the Danube
to the borders of Pæonia. All these dependencies were held only
by the fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span> of
Macedonian force. It remained to be proved whether the youthful son
of Philip was capable of putting down opposition and upholding the
powerful organization created by his father. Moreover Perdikkas,
the elder brother and predecessor of Philip, had left a son named
Amyntas, now at least twenty-four years of age, to whom many looked
as the proper successor.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>But Alexander, present and proclaimed at once by his friends,
showed himself both in word and deed, perfectly competent to the
emergency. He mustered, caressed, and conciliated, the divisions
of the Macedonian army and the chief officers. His addresses
were judicious and energetic, engaging that the dignity of the
kingdom should be maintained unimpaired,<a id="FNanchor_10"
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and that even the
Asiatic projects already proclaimed should be prosecuted with as much
vigor as if Philip still lived.</p>

<p>It was one of the first measures of Alexander to celebrate with
magnificent solemnities the funeral of his deceased father. While
the preparations for it were going on, he instituted researches
to find out and punish the accomplices of Pausanias. Of these
indeed, the most illustrious person mentioned to us—Olympias—was
not only protected by her position from punishment, but retained
great ascendency over her son to the end of his life. Three
other persons are mentioned by name as accomplices—brothers and
persons of good family from the district of Upper Macedonia called
Lynkêstis—Alexander, Heromenes, and Arrhabæus, sons of Aëropus.
The two latter were put to death, but the first of the three was
spared, and even promoted to important charges, as a reward for
his useful forwardness in instantly saluting Alexander king.<a
id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Others
also, we know not how many, were executed; and Alexander seems
to have imag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span>ined
that there still remained some undetected.<a id="FNanchor_12"
href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Persian king
boasted in public letters,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a> with how much truth we cannot say, that he
too had been among the instigators of Pausanias.</p>

<p>Among the persons slain about this time by Alexander, we may
number his first-cousin and brother-in-law Amyntas—son of Perdikkas
(the elder brother of the deceased Philip): Amyntas was a boy when
his father Perdikkas died. Though having a preferable claim to
the succession, according to usage, he had been put aside by his
uncle Philip, on the ground of his age and of the strenuous efforts
required on commencing a new reign. Philip had however given in
marriage to this Amyntas his daughter (by an Illyrian mother) Kynna.
Nevertheless, Alexander now put him to death,<a id="FNanchor_14"
href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> on accusation of
conspiracy: under what precise circumstances, does not appear—but
probably Amyntas (who besides being the son of Philip’s elder
brother, was at least twenty-four years of age, while Alexander
was only twenty) conceived himself as having a better right to the
succession, and was so conceived by many others. The infant son
of Kleopatra by Philip is said to have been killed by Alexander,
as a rival in the succession; Kleopatra herself was afterwards
put to death by Olympias during his absence, and to his regret.
Attalus, also, uncle of Kleopatra and joint commander of the
Macedonian army in Asia, was assassinated under the private<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span> orders of Alexander,
by Hekatæus and Philotas.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Another Amyntas, son of Antiochus
(there seems to have been several Macedonians named Amyntas) fled
for safety into Asia:<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a> probably others, who felt themselves
to be objects of suspicion, did the like—since by the Macedonian
custom, not merely a person convicted of high treason, but all
his kindred along with him, were put to death.<a id="FNanchor_17"
href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>By unequivocal manifestations of energy and address, and by
despatching rivals or dangerous malcontents, Alexander thus speedily
fortified his position on the throne at home. But from the foreign
dependents of Macedonia—Greeks, Thracians, and Illyrians—the like
acknowledgment was not so easily obtained. Most of them were disposed
to throw off the yoke; yet none dared to take the initiative of
moving, and the suddenness of Philip’s death found them altogether
unprepared for combination. By that event the Greeks were discharged
from all engagement, since the vote of the confederacy had elected
him personally as Imperator. They were now at liberty, in so far
as there was any liberty at all in the proceeding, to elect any
one else, or to abstain from reëlecting at all, and even to let
the confederacy expire. Now it was only under constraint and
intimidation, as was well known both in Greece and Macedonia, that
they had conferred this dignity even on Philip—who had earned it
by splendid exploits, and had proved himself the ablest captain
and politician of the age. They were by no means inclined to
transfer it to a youth like Alexander, until he had shown himself
capable of bringing the like coercion to bear, and extorting the
same submission. The wish to break loose from Macedonia, widely
spread throughout the Grecian cities, found open expression from
Demosthenes and others in the assembly at Athens. That orator (if
we are to believe his rival Æschines), having received private
intelligence of the assassination of Philip,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> through certain spies of Charidemus,
before it was publicly known to others—pretended to have had it
revealed to him in a dream by the gods. Appearing in the assembly
with his gayest attire, he congratulated his countrymen on the death
of their greatest enemy, and pronounced high encomiums on the brave
tyrannicide of Pausanias, which he would probably compare to that of
Harmodius and Aristogeiton.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He depreciated the abilities of Alexander,
calling him Margites (the name of a silly character in one of the
Homeric poems), and intimating that he would be too much distracted
with embarrassments and ceremonial duties at home, to have leisure
for a foreign march.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Such, according to Æschines, was the
language of Demosthenes on the first news of Philip’s death. We
cannot doubt that the public of Athens, as well as Demosthenes, felt
great joy at an event which seemed to open to them fresh chances
of freedom, and that the motion for a sacrifice of thanksgiving,<a
id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in
spite of Phokion’s opposition, was readily adopted. But though the
manifestation of sentiment at Athens was thus anti-Macedonian,
exhibiting aversion to the renewal of that obedience which had
been recently promised to Philip, Demosthenes did not go so
far as to declare any positive hostility.<a id="FNanchor_21"
href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He tried to open
communication with the Persians in Asia Minor, and also, if we may
believe Diodorus, with the Macedonian commander in Asia Minor,
Attalus. But neither of the two missions was successful. Attalus sent
his letter to Alexander; while the Persian king,<a id="FNanchor_22"
href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> probably relieved
by the death of Philip from immediate fear of Macedonian power,
despatched a peremptory refusal to Athens, intimating that he would
furnish no more money.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>Not merely
in Athens, but in other Grecian States also, the death of Philip
excited aspirations for freedom. The Lacedæmonians, who, though
unsupported, had stood out inflexibly against any obedience to
him, were now on the watch for new allies; while the Arcadians,
Argeians, and Eleians, manifested sentiments adverse to Macedonia.
The Ambrakiots expelled the garrison placed by Philip in their
city; the Ætolians passed a vote to assist in restoring those
Akarnanian exiles whom he had banished.<a id="FNanchor_24"
href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> On the other hand,
the Thessalians manifested unshaken adherence to Macedonia. But
the Macedonian garrison at Thebes, and the macedonizing Thebans
who now governed that city,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"
class="fnanchor">[25]</a> were probably the main obstacles to any
combined manifestation in favor of Hellenic autonomy.</p>

<p>Apprised of these impulses prevalent throughout the Grecian world,
Alexander felt the necessity of checking them by a demonstration
immediate, as well as intimidating. The energy and rapidity of his
proceedings speedily overawed all those who had speculated on his
youth, or had adopted the epithets applied to him by Demosthenes.
Having surmounted, in a shorter time than was supposed possible,
the difficulties of his newly-acquired position at home, he marched
into Greece at the head of a formidable army, seemingly about two
months after the death of Philip. He was favorably received by
the Thessalians, who passed a vote constituting Alexander head
of Greece in place of his father Philip; which vote was speedily
confirmed by the Amphiktyonic assembly, convoked at Thermopylæ.
Alexander next advanced to Thebes, and from thence over the isthmus
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span> Corinth into
Peloponnesus. The details of his march we do not know; but his
great force, probably not inferior to that which had conquered
at Chæroneia, spread terror everywhere, silencing all except his
partisans. Nowhere was the alarm greater than at Athens. The
Athenians recollecting both the speeches of their orators and the
votes of their assembly,—offensive at least, if not hostile, to the
Macedonians—trembled lest the march of Alexander should be directed
against their city, and accordingly made preparation for standing
a siege. All citizens were enjoined to bring in their families and
properties from the country, insomuch that the space within the
walls was full both of fugitives and of cattle.<a id="FNanchor_26"
href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> At the same time, the
assembly adopted, on the motion of Demades, a resolution of apology
and full submission to Alexander: they not only recognized him as
chief of Greece, but conferred upon him divine honors, in terms even
more emphatic than those bestowed on Philip.<a id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The mover, with other
legates, carried the resolution to Alexander, whom they found at
Thebes, and who accepted their submission. A young speaker named
Pytheas is said to have opposed the vote in the Athenian assembly.<a
id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Whether Demosthenes did the like—or whether, under the feeling of
disappointed anticipations and overwhelming Macedonian force, he
condemned himself to silence,—we cannot say. That he did not go
with Demades on the mission to Alexander, seems a matter of course,
though he is said to have been appointed by public vote to do so,
and to have declined the duty. He accompanied the legation as far
as Mount Kithæron, on the frontier, and then returned to Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> We
read with astonishment that Æschines and his other enemies<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span> denounced this step as a
cowardly desertion. No envoy could be so odious to Alexander, or so
likely to provoke refusal for the proposition which he carried, as
Demosthenes. To employ him in such a mission would have been absurd;
except for the purpose probably intended by his enemies, that he
might be either detained by the conqueror as an expiatory victim,<a
id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> or
sent back as a pardoned and humiliated prisoner.</p>

<p>After displaying his force in various portions of Peloponnesus,
Alexander returned to Corinth, where he convened deputies from the
Grecian cities generally. The list of those cities which obeyed
the summons is not before us, but probably it included nearly all
the cities of Central Greece. We know only that the Lacedæmonians
continued to stand aloof, refusing all concurrence. Alexander asked
from the assembled deputies the same appointment which the victorious
Philip had required and obtained two years before—the hegemony or
headship of the Greeks collectively for the purpose of prosecuting
war against Persia.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> To the request of a prince at the head
of an irresistible army, one answer only was admissible. He was
nominated Imperator with full powers, by land and sea. Overawed by
the presence and sentiment of Macedonian force, all acquiesced in
this vote except the Lacedæmonians.</p>

<p>The convention sanctioned by Alexander was probably the same
as that settled by and with his father Philip. Its grand and
significant feature was, that it recognized Hellas as a confederacy
under the Macedonian prince as imperator, president, or<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span> executive head and arm.
It crowned him with a legal sanction as keeper of the peace within
Greece, and conqueror abroad in the name of Greece. Of its other
conditions, some are made known to us by subsequent complaints; such
conditions as, being equitable and tutelary towards the members
generally, the Macedonian chief found it inconvenient to observe,
and speedily began to violate. Each Hellenic city was pronounced,
by the first article of the convention, to be free and autonomous.
In each, the existing political constitution was recognized as it
stood; all other cities were forbidden to interfere with it, or
to second any attack by its hostile exiles.<a id="FNanchor_32"
href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> No new despot was
to be established; no dispossessed despot was to be restored.<a
id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Each
city became bound to discourage in every other, as far as possible,
all illegal violence—such as political executions, confiscation,
spoliation, redivision of land or abolition of debts, factious
manumission of slaves, etc.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"
class="fnanchor">[34]</a> To each was guaranteed freedom of
navigation; maritime capture was prohibited, on pain of enmity from
all.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Each was forbidden to send armed vessels into the harbor of any
other, or to build vessels or engage seamen there.<a id="FNanchor_36"
href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> By each, an oath was
taken to observe these conditions, to declare war against all who
violated them, and to keep them inscribed on a commemorative column.
Provision seems to have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p.
15]</span> made for admitting any additional city<a id="FNanchor_37"
href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> on its subsequent
application, though it might not have been a party to the original
contract. Moreover, it appears that a standing military force,
under Macedonian orders, was provided to enforce observance of the
convention; and that the synod of deputies was contemplated as
likely to meet periodically.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Such was the convention, in so far as we know its terms, agreed to
by the Grecian deputies at Corinth with Alexander; but with Alexander
at the head of an irresistible army. He proclaimed it as the “public
statute of the Greeks”,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> constituting a paramount obligation, of
which he was the enforcer, binding on all, and authorizing him to
treat all transgressors as rebels. It was set forth as counterpart
of, and substitute for, the convention of Antalkidas, which we shall
presently see the officers of Darius trying to revive against him—the
headship of Persia against that of Macedonia. Such is the melancholy
degradation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> of
the Grecian World, that its cities have no alternative except to
choose between these two foreign potentates—or to invite the help
of Darius, the most distant and least dangerous, whose headship
could hardly be more than nominal, against a neighbor sure to be
domineering and compressive, and likely enough to be tyrannical. Of
the once powerful Hellenic chiefs and competitors—Sparta, Athens,
Thebes—under each of whom the Grecian world had been upheld as an
independent and self-determining aggregate, admitting the free
play of native sentiment and character, under circumstances more
or less advantageous—the two last are now confounded as common
units (one even held under garrison) among the subject allies of
Alexander; while Sparta preserves only the dignity of an isolated
independence.</p>

<p>It appears that during the nine months which succeeded the
swearing of the convention, Alexander and his officers (after his
return to Macedonia) were active, both by armed force and by mission
of envoys, in procuring new adhesions and in re-modelling the
governments of various cities suitably to their own views. Complaints
of such aggressions were raised in the public assembly of Athens,
the only place in Greece where any liberty of discussion still
survived. An oration, pronounced by Demosthenes, Hyperides, or one
of the contemporary, anti-Macedonian politicians (about the spring
or early summer of 335 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),<a
id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
imparts to us some idea both of the Macedonian interventions steadily
going on, and of the unavailing remonstrances raised against them
by individual Athenian citizens. At the time of this oration, such
remonstrances had already been often repeated. They were always
met by the macedonizing Athenians with peremptory declarations
that the convention must be observed.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> But in reply, the remonstrants urged,
that it was unfair to call upon Athens for strict observance of
the convention, while the Macedonians and their partisans in the
various cities were perpetually violating it for their own profit.
Alexander and his officers (affirms this orator) had never once
laid down their arms since the convention was settled. They had
been perpetually tampering with the governments of the various
cities, to promote their own partisans to power.<a id="FNanchor_41"
href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In Messênê, Sikyon,
and Pellênê, they had subverted the popular constitutions, banished
many citizens, and established friends of their own as despots. The
Macedonian force, destined as a public guarantee to enforce the
observance of the convention, had been employed only to overrule
its best conditions, and to arm the hands of factious partisans.<a
id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Thus Alexander in his capacity of Imperator, disregarding all
the restraints of the convention, acted as chief despot for the
maintenance of subordinate despots in the separate cities.<a
id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Even at Athens, this imperial authority had rescinded sentences of
the dikastery, and compelled the adoption of measures contrary to
the laws and constitution.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44"
class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>At sea, the wrongful aggressions of Alexander or his officers had
been not less manifest than on land. The convention, guaranteeing
to all cities the right of free navigation, distinctly forbade each
to take or detain vessels belonging to any other. Nevertheless the
Macedonians had seized, in the Hellespont, all the merchantmen
coming out with cargoes from the Euxine, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span> carried them into Tenedos, where they
were detained, under various fraudulent pretences, in spite of
remonstrances from the proprietors and cities whose supply of
corn was thus intercepted. Among these sufferers, Athens stood
conspicuous; since consumers of imported corn, ship-owners, and
merchants, were more numerous there than elsewhere. The Athenians,
addressing complaints and remonstrances without effect, became at
length so incensed, and perhaps uneasy about their provisions,
that they passed a decree to equip and despatch 100 triremes,
appointing Menestheus (son of Iphikrates) admiral. By this strenuous
manifestation, the Macedonians were induced to release the detained
vessels. Had the detention been prolonged, the Athenian fleet would
have sailed to extort redress by force; so that, as Athens was more
than a match for Macedon on sea, the maritime empire of the latter
would have been overthrown, while even on land much encouragement
would have been given to malcontents against it.<a id="FNanchor_45"
href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Another incident had
occurred, less grave than this, yet still dwelt upon by the orator
as an infringement of the convention, and as an insult to Athenians.
Though an express article of the convention prohibited armed ships
of one city from entering the harbor of another, still a Macedonian
trireme had been sent into Pieræus to ask permission that smaller
vessels might be built there for Macedonian account. This was
offensive to a large proportion of Athenians, not only as violating
the convention, but as a manifest step towards<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> employing the nautical equipments and
seamen of Athens for the augmentation of the Macedonian navy.<a
id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>“Let those speakers who are perpetually admonishing us to observe
the convention (the orator contends), prevail on the imperial chief
to set the example of observing it on his part. I too impress upon
you the like observance. To a democracy nothing is more essential
than scrupulous regard to equity and justice.<a id="FNanchor_47"
href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But the convention
itself enjoins all its members to make war against transgressors; and
pursuant to this article, you ought to make war against Macedon.<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Be
assured that all Greeks will see that the war is neither directed
against them nor brought on by your fault.<a id="FNanchor_49"
href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> At this juncture,
such a step for the maintenance of your own freedom as well
as Hellenic freedom generally, will be not less opportune and
advantageous than it is just.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50"
class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The time is come for shaking off
your disgraceful submission to others, and your oblivion of
our own past dignity.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a> If you encourage me, I am prepared to
make a formal motion—To declare war against the violators of the
convention, as the convention itself directs.”<a id="FNanchor_52"
href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>A formal motion for declaring war would have brought upon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span> the mover a prosecution
under the Graphê Paranomôn. Accordingly, though intimating clearly
that he thought the actual juncture (what it was, we do not know)
suitable, he declined to incur such responsibility without seeing
beforehand a manifestation of public sentiment sufficient to give
him hopes of a favorable verdict from the Dikastery. The motion was
probably not made. But a speech so bold, even though not followed
up by a motion, is in itself significant of the state of feeling
in Greece during the months immediately following the Alexandrine
convention. This harangue is only one among many delivered in the
Athenian assembly, complaining of Macedonian supremacy as exercised
under the convention. It is plain that the acts of Macedonian
officers were such as to furnish ample ground for complaint; and the
detention of all the trading ships coming out of the Euxine, shows
us that even the subsistence of Athens and the islands had become
more or less endangered. Though the Athenians resorted to no armed
interference, their assembly at least afforded a theatre where public
protest could be raised and public sympathy manifested.</p>

<p>It is probable too that at this time Demosthenes and the other
anti-Macedonian speakers were encouraged by assurances and subsidies
from Persia. Though the death of Philip, and the accession of an
untried youth of twenty, had led Darius to believe for the moment
that all danger of Asiatic invasion was past, yet his apprehensions
were now revived by Alexander’s manifested energy, and by the renewal
of the Grecian league under his supremacy.<a id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It was apparently
during the spring of 335 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that Darius sent
money to sustain the anti-Macedonian party at Athens and elsewhere.
Æschines affirms, and Deinarchus afterwards repeats (both of them
orators hostile to Demosthenes)—That about this time, Darius sent
to Athens 300 talents, which the Athenian people refused, but which
Demosthenes took, reserving however 70 talents out of the sum for
his own private purse: That public inquiry was afterwards instituted
on the subject. Yet nothing is alleged as having been made out;<a
id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> at
least Demosthenes was neither condemned, nor<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span> even brought (as far as appears) to
any formal trial. Out of such data we can elicit no specific fact.
But they warrant the general conclusion, that Darius, or the
satraps in Asia Minor, sent money to Athens in the spring of 335
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and letters or emissaries to excite
hostilities against Alexander.</p>

<p>That Demosthenes, and probably other leading orators, received
such remittances from Persia, is no evidence of that personal
corruption which is imputed to them by their enemies. It is no
way proved that Demosthenes applied the money to his own private
purposes. To receive and expend it in trying to organize combinations
for the enfranchisement of Greece, was a proceeding which he would
avow as not only legitimate but patriotic. It was aid obtained from
one foreign prince to enable Hellas to throw off the worse dominion
of another. At this moment, the political interests of Persia
coincided with that of all Greeks who aspired to freedom. Darius
had no chance of becoming master of Greece; but his own security
prescribed to him to protect her from being made an appendage of the
Macedonian kingdom, and his means of doing so were at this moment
ample, had they been efficaciously put forth. Now the purpose of a
Greek patriot would be to preserve the integrity and autonomy of
the Hellenic world against all foreign interference. To invoke the
aid of Persia against Hellenic enemies,—as Sparta had done both
in the Peloponnesian war and at the peace of Antalkidas, and as
Thebes and Athens had followed her example in doing afterwards—was
an unwarrantable proceeding: but to invoke the same aid against the
dominion of another foreigner, at once nearer and more formidable,
was open to no blame on the score either of patriotism or policy.
Demosthenes had vainly urged his countrymen to act with energy
against Philip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span> at
a time when they might by their own efforts have upheld the existing
autonomy both for Athens and for Greece generally. He now seconded
or invited Darius, at a time when Greece single-handed had become
incompetent to the struggle against Alexander, the common enemy
both of Grecian liberty and of the Persian empire. Unfortunately
for Athens as well as for himself, Darius, with full means of
resistance in his hands, played his game against Alexander even with
more stupidity and improvidence than Athens had played hers against
Philip.</p>

<p>While such were the aggressions of Macedonian officers in the
exercise of their new imperial authority, throughout Greece and the
islands—and such the growing manifestations of repugnance to it at
Athens—Alexander had returned home to push the preparations for his
Persian campaign. He did not however think it prudent to transport
his main force into Asia, until he had made his power and personal
ascendency felt by the Macedonian dependencies, westward, northward,
and north-eastward of Pella—Illyrians, Pæonians, and Thracians.
Under these general names were comprised a number<a id="FNanchor_55"
href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of distinct tribes, or
nations, warlike and for the most part predatory. Having remained
unconquered until the victories of Philip, they were not kept in
subjection even by him without difficulty: nor were they at all
likely to obey his youthful successor, until they had seen some
sensible evidence of his personal energy.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in the spring, Alexander put himself at the head of
a large force, and marched in an easterly direction from Amphipolis,
through the narrow Sapæan pass between Philippi and the sea.<a
id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In
ten days’ march he reached the difficult mountain path over which
alone he could cross Mount Hæmus (Balkan.) Here he found a body of
the free Thracians and of armed merchants of the country, assembled
to oppose his progress; posted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p.
23]</span> on the high ground with waggons in their front, which
it was their purpose to roll down the steep declivity against the
advancing ranks of the Macedonians. Alexander eluded this danger
by ordering his soldiers either to open their ranks, so as to let
the waggons go through freely—or where there was no room for such
loose array, to throw themselves on the ground with their shields
closely packed together and slanting over their bodies; so that the
waggons, dashing down the steep and coming against the shields, were
carried off the ground, and made to bound over the bodies of the men
to the space below. All the waggons rolled down without killing a
single man. The Thracians, badly armed, were then easily dispersed
by the Macedonian attack, with the loss of 1500 men killed, and
all their women and children made prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_57"
href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The captives and
plunder were sent back under an escort to be sold at the seaports.</p>

<p>Having thus forced the mountain road, Alexander led his army
over the chain of Mount Hæmus, and marched against the Triballi: a
powerful Thracian tribe,—extending (as far as can be determined)
from the plain of Kossovo in modern Servia northward towards the
Danube,—whom Philip had conquered, yet not without considerable
resistance and even occasional defeat. Their prince Syrmus had
already retired with the women and children of the tribe into an
island of the Danube called Peukê, where many other Thracians had
also sought shelter. The main force of the Triballi took post in
woody ground on the banks of the rivet Zyginus, about three days’
march from the Danube. Being tempted however, by an annoyance from
the Macedonian light-armed, to emerge from their covered position
into the open plain, they were here attacked by Alexander with his
cavalry and infantry, in close combat, and completely defeated.
Three thousand of them were slain, but the rest mostly<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span> eluded pursuit by means
of the wood, so that they lost few prisoners. The loss of the
Macedonians was only eleven horsemen and forty foot slain; according
to the statement of Ptolemy, son of Lagus, then one of Alexander’s
confidential officers, and afterwards founder of the dynasty of
Greco-Egyptian kings.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Three days’ march, from the scene of action, brought Alexander to
the Danube, where he found some armed ships which had been previously
ordered to sail (probably with stores of provision) from Byzantium
round by the Euxine and up the river. He first employed these ships
in trying to land a body of troops on the island of Peukê; but his
attempt was frustrated by the steep banks, the rapid stream, and the
resolute front of the defenders on shore. To compensate for this
disappointment, Alexander resolved to make a display of his strength
by crossing the Danube and attacking the Getæ; tribes, chiefly
horsemen armed with bows,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a> analogous to the Thracians in habits and
language. They occupied the left bank of the river, from which their
town was about four miles distant. The terror of the Macedonian
successes had brought together a body of 4000 Getæ, visible from
the opposite shore, to resist any crossing. Accordingly Alexander
got together a quantity of the rude boats (hollowed out of a single
trunk) employed for transport on the river, and caused the tent-skins
of the army to be stuffed with hay in order to support rafts. He
then put himself on shipboard during the night, and contrived to
carry across the river a body of 4000 infantry, and 1500 cavalry;
landing on a part of the bank where there was high standing wheat and
no enemy’s post. The Getæ, intimidated not less by this successful
passage than by the excellent array of Alexander’s army, hardly
stayed to sustain a charge of cavalry, but hastened to abandon
their poorly fortified town and retire father away from the river.
Entering the town without resistance, he destroyed it, carried away
such movables as he found, and then returned to the river without
delay. Before he quitted the northern bank, he offered sacrifice
to Zeus the Preserver—to Hêraklês—and to the god Ister (Danube)
himself, whom he thanked for having shown himself not impassable.<a
id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span> the very same
day, he recrossed the river to his camp; after an empty demonstration
of force, intended to prove that he could do what neither his father
nor any Grecian army had ever yet done, and what every one deemed
impossible—crossing the greatest of all known rivers without a bridge
and in the face of an enemy.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>The terror
spread by Alexander’s military operations was so great, that not
only the Triballi, but the other autonomous Thracians around, sent
envoys tendering presents or tribute, and soliciting peace. Alexander
granted their request. His mind being bent upon war with Asia, he
was satisfied with having intimidated these tribes so as to deter
them from rising during his absence. What conditions he imposed,
we do not know, but he accepted the presents.<a id="FNanchor_62"
href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>While these applications from the Thracians were under debate,
envoys arrived from a tribe of Gauls occupying a distant mountainous
region westward towards the Ionic Gulf. Though strangers to
Alexander, they had heard so much of the recent<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span> exploits, that they came with demands to
be admitted to his friendship. They were distinguished both for tall
stature and for boastful language. Alexander readily exchanged with
them assurances of alliance. Entertaining them at a feast, he asked,
in the course of conversation, what it was that they were most afraid
of, among human contingencies? They replied, that they feared no man,
nor any danger, except only, lest the heaven should fall upon them.
Their answer disappointed Alexander, who had expected that they would
name him, as the person of whom they were most afraid; so prodigious
was his conceit of his own exploits. He observed to his friends that
these Gauls were swaggerers. Yet if we attend to the sentiment rather
than the language, we shall see that such an epithet applies with
equal or greater propriety to Alexander himself. The anecdote is
chiefly interesting as it proves at how early an age the exorbitant
self-esteem, which we shall hereafter find him manifesting, began.
That after the battle of Issus he should fancy himself superhuman, we
can hardly be astonished; but he was as yet only in the first year of
his reign, and had accomplished nothing beyond his march into Thrace
and his victory over the Triballi.</p>

<p>After arranging these matters, he marched in a south-westerly
direction into the territory of the Agriânes and the other Pæonians,
between the rivers Strymon and Axius in the highest portion of their
course. Here he was met by a body of Agriânes under their prince
Langarus, who had already contracted a personal friendship for him
at Pella before Philip’s death. News came that the Illyrian Kleitus,
son of Bardylis, who had been subdued by Philip, had revolted at
Pelion (a strong post south of lake Lychnidus, on the west side of
the chain of Skardus and Pindus, near the place where that chain
is broken by the cleft called the Klissura of Tzangon or Devol<a
id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>)—and
that the western Illyrians, called Taulantii, under their prince
Glaukias, were on the march to assist him. Accordingly Alexander
proceeded thither forthwith, leaving Langarus to deal with the
Illyrian tribe Autariatæ, who had threatened to oppose his progress.
He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span> marched
along the bank and up the course of the Erigon, from a point near
where it joins the Axius.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> On approaching Pelion, he found the
Illyrians posted in front of the town and on the heights around,
awaiting the arrival of Glaukias their promised ally. While Alexander
was making his dispositions for attack, they offered their sacrifices
to the gods: the victims being three boys, three girls, and three
black rams. At first they stepped boldly forward to meet him, but
before coming to close quarters, they turned and fled into the town
with such haste that the slain victims were left lying on the spot.<a
id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Having
thus driven in the defenders, Alexander was preparing to draw a wall
of circumvallation round the Pelion, when he was interrupted by
the arrival of Glaukias with so large a force as to compel him to
abandon the project. A body of cavalry, sent out from the Macedonian
camp under Philotas to forage, were in danger of being cut off by
Glaukias, and were only rescued by the arrival of Alexander himself
with a reinforcement. In the face of this superior force, it was
necessary to bring off the Macedonian army, through a narrow line of
road along the river Eordaikus, where in some places there was only
room for four abreast, with hill or marsh everywhere around. By a
series of bold and skilful manœuvres, and by effective employment of
his battering-train or projectile machines to protect the rear-guard,
Alexander completely baffled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p.
29]</span> the enemy, and brought off his army without loss.<a
id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Moreover these Illyrians, who had not known how to make use of such
advantages of position, abandoned themselves to disorder as soon
as their enemy had retreated, neglecting all precautions for the
safety of their camp. Apprised of this carelessness, Alexander made
a forced night-march back, at the head of his Agrianian division
and light troops supported by the remaining army. He surprised the
Illyrians in their camp before daylight. The success of this attack
against a sleeping and unguarded army was so complete, that the
Illyrians fled at once without resistance. Many were slain or taken
prisoners; the rest, throwing away their arms, hurried away homeward,
pursued by Alexander for a considerable distance. The Illyrian prince
Kleitus was forced to evacuate Pelion, which place he burned, and
then retired into the territory of Glaukias.<a id="FNanchor_67"
href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Just as Alexander had completed this victory over Kleitus and
the Taulantian auxiliaries, and before he had returned home, news
reached him of a menacing character. The Thebans had declared
themselves independent of him, and were besieging his garrison in the
Kadmeia.</p>

<p>Of this event, alike important and disastrous to those who stood
forward, the immediate antecedents are very imperfectly known to
us. It has already been remarked that the vote of submission on the
part of the Greeks to Alexander as Imperator, during the preceding
autumn, had been passed only under the intimidation of a present
Macedonian force. Though the Spartans alone had courage to proclaim
their dissent, the Athenians, Arcadians, Ætolians, and others,
were well known even to Alexander himself, as ready to do the like
on any serious reverse to the Macedonian arms.<a id="FNanchor_68"
href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Moreover the energy
and ability displayed by Alexander had taught the Persian king that
all danger to himself was not removed by the death of Philip, and
induced him either to send, or to promise, pecuniary aid to the
anti-Macedonian Greeks. We have already noticed the manifestation
of anti-Macedonian sentiment at Athens—proclaimed by several of
the most eminent orators—Demosthenes, Lykur<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span>gus, Hyperides, and others; as well as by
active military men like Charidemus and Ephialtes,<a id="FNanchor_69"
href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> who probably spoke
out more boldly when Alexander was absent on the Danube. In other
cities, the same sentiment doubtless found advocates, though
less distinguished; but at Thebes, where it could not be openly
proclaimed, it prevailed with the greatest force.<a id="FNanchor_70"
href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The Thebans suffered
an oppression from which most of the other cities were free—the
presence of a Macedonian garrison in their citadel; just as they
had endured, fifty years before, the curb of a Spartan garrison
after the fraud of Phœbidas and Leontiades. In this case, as in the
former, the effect was to arm the macedonizing leaders with absolute
power over their fellow-citizens, and to inflict upon the latter
not merely the public mischief of extinguishing all free speech,
but also multiplied individual insults and injuries, prompted by
the lust and rapacity of rulers, foreign as well as domestic.<a
id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> A
number of Theban citizens, among them the freest and boldest spirits,
were in exile at Athens, receiving from the public indeed nothing
beyond a safe home, but secretly encouraged to hope for better
things by Demosthenes and the other anti-Macedonian leaders.<a
id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In
like manner, fifty years before, it was at Athens, and from private
Athenian citizens, that the Thebans Pelopidas and Mellon had found
that sympathy which enabled them to organize their daring conspiracy
for rescuing Thebes from the Spartans. That enterprise,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span> admired throughout Greece
as alike adventurous, skilful, and heroic, was the model present to
the imagination of the Theban exiles, to be copied if any tolerable
opportunity occurred.</p>

<p>Such was the feeling in Greece, during the long absence of
Alexander on his march into Thrace and Illyria; a period of four or
five months, ending at August 335 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Not only
was Alexander thus long absent, but he sent home no reports of his
proceedings. Couriers were likely enough to be intercepted among the
mountains and robbers of Thrace; and even if they reached Pella,
their despatches were not publicly read, as such communications
would have been read to the Athenian assembly. Accordingly we are
not surprised to hear that rumors arose of his having been defeated
and slain. Among these reports, both multiplied and confident, one
was even certified by a liar who pretended to have just arrived
from Thrace, to have been an eye-witness of the fact, and to have
been himself wounded in the action against the Triballi, where
Alexander had perished.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> This welcome news, not fabricated, but too
hastily credited, by Demosthenes and Lykurgus,<a id="FNanchor_74"
href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> was announced to the
Athenian assembly. In spite of doubts expressed by Demades and
Phokion, it was believed not only by the Athenians and the Theban
exiles there present, but also by the Arcadians, Eleians, Ætolians
and other Greeks. For a considerable time, through the absence<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span> of Alexander, it remained
uncontradicted, which increased the confidence in its truth.</p>

<p>It was upon the full belief in this rumor, of Alexander’s defeat
and death, that the Grecian cities proceeded. The event severed
by itself their connection with Macedonia. There was neither son
nor adult brother to succeed to the throne: so that not merely the
foreign ascendency, but even the intestine unity, of Macedonia,
was likely to be broken up. In regard to Athens, Arcadia, Elis,
Ætolia, etc., the anti-Macedonian sentiment was doubtless vehemently
manifested, but no special action was called for. It was otherwise
in regard to Thebes. Phœnix, Prochytes, and other Theban exiles at
Athens, immediately laid their plan for liberating their city and
expelling the Macedonian garrison from the Kadmeia. Assisted with
arms and money by Demosthenes and other Athenian citizens, and
invited by their partisans at Thebes, they suddenly entered that
city in arms. Though unable to carry the Kadmeia by surprise, they
seized in the city, and put to death, Amyntas, a principal Macedonian
officer, with Timolaus, one of the leading macedonizing Thebans.<a
id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
They then immediately convoked a general assembly of the Thebans,
to whom they earnestly appealed for a vigorous effort to expel
the Macedonians, and reconquer the ancient freedom of the city.
Expatiating upon the misdeeds of the garrison and upon the
oppressions of those Thebans who governed by means of the garrison,
they proclaimed that the happy moment of liberation had now arrived,
through the recent death of Alexander. They doubtless recalled the
memory of Pelopidas, and the glorious enterprise, cherished by
all Theban patriots, whereby he had rescued the city from Spartan
occupation, forty-six years before. To this appeal the Thebans
cordially responded. The assembly passed a vote, declaring severance
from Macedonia, and autonomy of Thebes—and naming as Bœotarchs some
of the returned exiles, with others of the same party, for the
purpose of energetic measures against the garrison in the Kadmeia.<a
id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately for Thebes, none of these new Bœotarchs were men
of the stamp of Epaminondas, probably not even of Pelopi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span>das. Yet their scheme,
though from its melancholy result it is generally denounced as
insane, really promised better at first than that of the anti-Spartan
conspirators in 380 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The
Kadmeia was instantly summoned; hopes being perhaps indulged,
that the Macedonian commander would surrender it with as little
resistance as the Spartan harmost had done. But such hopes were
not realized. Philip had probably caused the citadel to be both
strengthened and provisioned. The garrison defied the Theban
leaders, who did not feel themselves strong enough to give orders
for an assault, as Pelopidas in his time was prepared to do, if
surrender had been denied.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a> They contented themselves with drawing
and guarding a double line of circumvallation round the Kadmeia, so
as to prevent both sallies from within and supplies from without.<a
id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> They
then sent envoys in the melancholy equipment of suppliants, to
the Arcadians and others, representing that their recent movement
was directed, not against Hellenic union, but against Macedonian
oppression and outrage, which pressed upon them with intolerable
bitterness. As Greeks and freemen, they entreated aid to rescue them
from such a calamity. They obtained much favorable sympathy, with
some promise and even half-performance. Many of the leading orators
at Athens—Demosthenes, Lykurgus, Hyperides, and others—together
with the military men Charidemus and Ephialtes—strongly urged their
countrymen to declare in favor of Thebes and send aid against
the Kadmeia. But the citizens generally, following Demades and
Phokion, waited to be better assured both of Alexander’s death
and of its consequences, before they would incur the hazard
of open hostility against Macedonia, though they seem to have
declared sympathy with the Theban revolution.<a id="FNanchor_79"
href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Demosthenes farther
went as envoy into Peloponnesus, while the Macedonian Antipater
also sent round urgent applications to the Peloponnesian cities,
requiring their contingents, as members of the confederacy under
Alexander, to act against Thebes. The eloquence of Demosthenes,
backed by his money, or by Persian money administered through<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span> him, prevailed on the
Peloponnesians to refuse compliance with Antipater and to send no
contingents against Thebes.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80"
class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The Eleians and Ætolians held out general
assurances favorable to the revolution at Thebes, while the
Arcadians even went so far as to send out some troops to second it,
though they did not advance beyond the isthmus.<a id="FNanchor_81"
href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Here was a crisis in Grecian affairs, opening new possibilities
for the recovery of freedom. Had the Arcadians and other Greeks
lent decisive aid to Thebes—had Athens acted even with as much
energy as she did twelve years afterwards during the Lamian war,
occupying Thermopylæ with an army and a fleet—the gates of Greece
might well have been barred against a new Macedonian force, even
with Alexander alive and at its head. That the struggle of Thebes
was not regarded at the time, even by macedonizing Greeks, as
hopeless, is shown by the subsequent observations both of Æschines
and Deinarchus at Athens. Æschines (delivering five years afterwards
his oration against Ktesiphon) accuses Demosthenes of having by his
perverse backwardness brought about the ruin of Thebes. The foreign
mercenaries forming part of the garrison of the Kadmeia were ready
(Æschines affirms) to deliver up that fortress, on receiving five
talents: the Arcadian generals would have brought up their troops
to the aid of Thebes, if nine or ten talents had been paid to
them—having repudiated the solicitations of Antipater. Demosthenes
(say these two orators) having in his possession 300 talents from the
Persian king, to instigate anti-Macedonian movements in Greece, was
supplicated by the Theban envoys to furnish money for these purposes,
but refused the request, kept the money for himself, and thus
prevented both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>
surrender of the Kadmeia and the onward march of the Arcadians.<a
id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
The charge here advanced against Demosthenes appears utterly
incredible. To suppose that anti-Macedonian movements counted
for so little in his eyes, is an hypothesis belied by his whole
history. But the fact that such allegations were made by Æschines
only five years afterwards, proves the reports and the feelings of
the time—that the chances of successful resistance to Macedonia on
the part of the Thebans were not deemed unfavorable. And when the
Athenians, following the counsels of Demades and Phokion, refused
to aid Thebes or occupy Thermopylæ—they perhaps consulted the
safety of Athens separately, but they receded from the generous
and Pan-hellenic patriotism which had animated their ancestors
against Xerxes and Mardonius.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The Thebans, though left in this ungenerous isolation, pressed
the blockade of the Kadmeia, and would presently have reduced the
Macedonian garrison, had they not been surprised by the awe-striking
event—Alexander arriving in person at Onchêstus in Bœotia, at the
head of his victorious army. The first news of his being alive was
furnished by his arrival at Onchêstus. No<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span> one could at first believe the fact.
The Theban leaders contended that it was another Alexander, the
son of Aëropus, at the head of a Macedonian army of relief.<a
id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In this incident we may note two features, which characterized
Alexander to the end of his life; matchless celerity of movement,
and no less remarkable favor of fortune. Had news of the Theban
rising first reached him while on the Danube or among the distant
Triballi,—or even when embarrassed in the difficult region round
Pelion,—he could hardly by any effort have arrived in time to save
the Kadmeia. But he learnt it just when he had vanquished Kleitus and
Glaukias, so that his hands were perfectly free—and also when he was
in a position peculiarly near and convenient for a straight march
into Greece without going back to Pella. From the pass of Tschangon
(or of the river Devol), near which Alexander’s last victories were
gained, his road lay southward, following downwards in part the
higher course of the river Haliakmon, through Upper Macedonia or the
regions called Eordæa and Elymeia which lay on his left, while the
heights of Pindus and the upper course of the river Aous, occupied
by the Epirots called Tymphæi and Parauæi, were on the right. On the
seventh day of march, crossing the lower ridges of the Cambunian
mountains (which separate Olympus from Pindus and Upper Macedonia
from Thessaly), Alexander reached the Thessalian town of Pelinna. Six
days more brought him to the Bœotian Onchestus.<a id="FNanchor_85"
href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> He was already within
Thermopylæ, before any Greeks were aware that he was in march, or
even that he was alive. The question about occupying Thermopylæ by
a Grecian force was thus set aside. The difficulty of forcing that
pass, and the necessity of forestalling Athens in it by stratagem or
celerity, was present to the mind of Alexander, as it had been to
that of Philip in his expedition of 346 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
against the Phokians.</p>

<p>His arrival, in itself a most formidable event, told with double
force on the Greeks from its extreme suddenness. We can<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> hardly doubt that both
Athenians and Thebans had communications at Pella—that they looked
upon any Macedonian invasion as likely to come from thence—and that
they expected Alexander himself (assuming him to be still living,
contrary to their belief) back in his capital before he began any
new enterprise. Upon this hypothesis—in itself probable, and such as
would have been realized if Alexander had not already advanced so far
southward at the moment when he received the news<a id="FNanchor_86"
href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>—they would at least
have known beforehand of his approach, and would have had the option
of a defensive combination open. As it happened, his unexpected
appearance in the heart of Greece precluded all combinations, and
checked all idea of resistance.</p>

<p>Two days after his arrival in Bœotia, he marched his army round
Thebes, so as to encamp on the south side of the city; whereby he
both intercepted the communication of the Thebans with Athens, and
exhibited his force more visibly to the garrison in the Kadmeia.
The Thebans, though alone and without hope of succor, maintained
their courage unshaken. Alexander deferred the attack for a day
or two, in hopes that they would submit; he wished to avoid an
assault which might cost the lives of many of his soldiers, whom he
required for his Asiatic schemes. He even made public proclamation,<a
id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
demanding the surrender of the anti-Macedonian leaders Phœnix
and Prochytes, but offering to any other Theban who chose to
quit the city, permission to come and join him on the terms of
the convention sworn in the preceding autumn. A general assembly
being convened, the macedonizing Thebans enforced the prudence
of submission to an irresistible force. But the leaders recently
returned from exile, who had headed the rising, warmly opposed this
proposition, contending for resistance to the death. In them, such
resolution may not be wonderful, since (as Arrian<a id="FNanchor_88"
href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> remarks) they had
gone too far to hope for lenity. As it appears however that the
mass of citizens deliberately adopted the same resolution, in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> spite of strong
persuasion to the contrary,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89"
class="fnanchor">[89]</a> we see plainly that they had already
felt the bitterness of Macedonian dominion, and that sooner than
endure a renewal of it, sure to be yet worse, coupled with the
dishonor of surrendering their leaders—they had made up their
minds to perish with the freedom of their city. At a time when the
sentiment of Hellas as an autonomous system was passing away, and
when Grecian courage was degenerating into a mere instrument for the
aggrandizement of Macedonian chiefs, these countrymen of Epaminondas
and Pelopidas set an example of devoted self-sacrifice in the cause
of Grecian liberty, not less honorable than that of Leonidas at
Thermopylæ, and only less esteemed because it proved infructuous.</p>

<p>In reply to the proclamation of Alexander, the Thebans made
from their walls a counter-proclamation, demanding the surrender
of his officers Antipater and Philotas, and inviting every one to
join them, who desired, in concert with the Persian king and the
Thebans, to liberate the Greeks and put down the despot of Hellas.<a
id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Such
a haughty defiance and retort incensed Alexander to the quick.
He brought up his battering engines and prepared everything for
storming the town. Of the murderous assault which followed, we find
different accounts, not agreeing with each other, yet not wholly
irreconcilable. It appears that the Thebans had erected, probably
in connection with their operations against the Kadmeia, an outwork
defended by a double palisade. Their walls were guarded by the least
effective soldiers, metics and liberated slaves; while their best
troops were bold enough to go forth in front of the gates and give
battle. Alexander divided his army into three divisions; one under
Perdikkas and Amyntas, against the outwork—a second, destined to
combat the Thebans who sallied out—and a third, held in reserve.
Between the second of these three divisions, and the Thebans in front
of the gates, the battle was so obstinately contested, that success
at one time seemed doubtful, and Alexander was forced to order up
his reserve. The first Macedonian success was gained by Perdikkas,<a
id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> who,
aided by the division of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p.
39]</span> Amyntas and also by the Agrianian regiment and the bowmen
carried the first of the two outworks, as well as a postern gate
which had been left unguarded. His troops also stormed the second
outwork, though he himself was severely wounded and borne away to
the camp. Here the Theban defenders fled back<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span> into the city, along the hollow way
which led to the temple of Herakles, pursued by the light troops, in
advance of the rest. Upon these men, however, the Thebans presently
turned, repelling them with the loss of Eurybotas their commanding
officer and seventy men slain. In pursuing these bowmen, the ranks
of the Thebans became somewhat disordered, so that they were unable
to resist the steady charge of the Macedonian guards and heavy
infantry coming up in support. They were broken, and pushed back
into the city; their rout being rendered still more complete by a
sally of the Macedonian garrison out of the Kadmeia. The assailants
being victorious on this side, the Thebans who were maintaining
the combat without the gates were compelled to retreat, and the
advancing Macedonians forced their way into the town along with
them. Within the town, however, the fighting still continued; the
Thebans resisting in organized bodies as long as they could; and when
broken, still resisting even single-handed. None of the military
population sued for mercy; most of them were slain in the streets;
but a few cavalry and infantry cut their way out into the plain and
escaped. The fight now degenerated into a carnage. The Macedonians
with their Pæonian contingents were incensed with the obstinate
resistance; while various Greeks serving as auxiliaries—Phokians,
Orchomenians, Thespians, Platæans,—had to avenge ancient and grievous
injuries endured from Thebes. Such furious feelings were satiated
by an indiscriminate massacre of all who came in their way, without
distinction of age or sex—old men, women, and children, in houses
and even in temples. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p.
41]</span> wholesale slaughter was accompanied of course by all
the plunder and manifold outrage with which victorious assailants
usually reward themselves.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92"
class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>More than five hundred Macedonians are asserted to have
been slain, and six thousand Thebans. Thirty thousand captives
were collected.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The final destiny of these captives, and
of Thebes itself, was submitted by Alexander to the Orchomenians,
Platæans, Phokians, and other Grecian auxiliaries in the assault.
He must have known well beforehand what the sentence of such judges
would be. They pronounced, that the city of Thebes should be
razed to the ground: that the Kadmeia alone should be maintained,
as a military post with Macedonian garrison: that the Theban
territory should be distributed among the allies themselves: that
Orchomenus and Platæa should be rebuilt and fortified: that all
the captive Thebans, men, women, and children, should be sold
as slaves—excepting only priests and priestesses, and such as
were connected by recognized ties of hospitality with Philip or
Alexander, or such as had been <i>proxeni</i> of the Macedonians; that
the Thebans who had escaped should be proclaimed outlaws, liable to
arrest and death, wherever they were found; and that every Grecian
city should be interdicted from harboring them.<a id="FNanchor_94"
href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>This overwhelming sentence, in spite of an appeal for
lenity by a Theban<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a> named Kleadas, was passed by the Grecian
auxiliaries of Alexander, and executed by Alexander himself, who
made but one addition to the excepting clauses. He left the house of
Pindar standing, and spared the descendants of the poet. With these
reserves, Thebes was effaced from the earth. The Theban territory
was partitioned among the reconstituted cities of Orchomenus and
Platæa. Nothing, except the Macedonian military post at the Kadmeia,
remained to mark the place where the chief of the Bœotian confederacy
had once stood. The captives were all sold, and are said to have
yielded 440 talents; large prices being offered by bidders from
feelings of hostility towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p.
42]</span> the city.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Diodorus tells us that this sentence was
passed by the general synod of Greeks. But we are not called upon to
believe that this synod, subservient though it was sure to be when
called upon to deliberate under the armed force of Alexander, could
be brought to sanction such a ruin upon one of the first and most
ancient Hellenic cities. For we learn from Arrian that the question
was discussed and settled only by the Grecian auxiliaries who had
taken part with Alexander;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and that the sentence therefore represents
the bitter antipathies of the Orchomenians, Platæans, etc. Without
doubt, these cities had sustained harsh and cruel treatment from
Thebes. In so far as they were concerned, the retribution upon
the Thebans was merited. Those persons, however, who (as Arrian
tells us) pronounced the catastrophe to be a divine judgment upon
Thebes for having joined Xerxes against Greece<a id="FNanchor_98"
href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> a century and a half
before,—must have forgotten that not only the Orchomenians, but
even Alexander of Macedon, the namesake and predecessor of the
destroying conqueror, had served in the army of Xerxes along with the
Thebans.</p>

<p>Arrian vainly endeavors to transfer from Alexander to the minor
Bœotian towns the odium of this cruel destruction—unparalleled in
Grecian history (as he himself says), when we look to the magnitude
of the city; yet surpassed in the aggregate by the subversion,
under the arms of Philip, of no less than thirty-two free Chalkidic
cities, thirteen years before. The known antipathy of these Bœotians
was invoked by Alexander to color an infliction which satisfied at
once his sentiment, by destroying an enemy who defied him—and his
policy, by serving as a terrific example to keep down other Greeks.<a
id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span> though such
were the views which governed him at the moment, he came afterwards
to look back upon the proceeding with shame and sorrow. The shock to
Hellenic feeling, when a city was subverted, arose not merely from
the violent extinction of life, property, liberty, and social or
political institutions—but also from the obliteration of legends and
the suppression of religious observances, thus wronging and provoking
the local gods and heroes. We shall presently find Alexander himself
sacrificing at Ilium,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100"
class="fnanchor">[100]</a> in order to appease the wrath of Priam,
still subsisting and efficacious, against himself and his race,
as being descended from Neoptolemus the slayer of Priam. By his
harsh treatment of Thebes, he incurred the displeasure of Dionysus,
the god of wine, said to have been born in that city, and one of
the principal figures in Theban legend. It was to inspirations
of the offended Dionysus that Alexander believed himself to owe
that ungovernable drunken passion under which he afterwards killed
Kleitus, as well as the refusal of his Macedonian soldiers to follow
him farther into India.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101"
class="fnanchor">[101]</a> If Alexander in after days thus<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p. 44]</span> repented of his own act,
we may be sure that the like repugnance was felt still more strongly
by others; and we can understand the sentiment under which, a few
years after his decease, the Macedonian Kassander, son of Antipater,
restored the destroyed city.</p>

<p>At the time, however, the effect produced by the destruction of
Thebes was one of unmitigated terror throughout the Grecian cities.
All of them sought to make their peace with the conqueror. The
Arcadian contingent not only returned home from the Isthmus, but even
condemned their leaders to death. The Eleians recalled their chief
macedonizing citizens out of exile into ascendency at home. Each
tribe of Ætolians sent envoys to Alexander, entreating forgiveness
for the manifestations against him. At Athens, we read with surprise
that on the very day when Thebes was assaulted and taken, the great
festival of Eleusinian Dêmêtêr, with its multitudinous procession
of votaries from Athens to Eleusis, was actually taking place, at
a distance of two days’ march from the besieged city. Most Theban
fugitives who contrived to escape, fled to Attica as the nearest
place of refuge, communicating to the Athenians their own distress
and terror. The festival was forthwith suspended. Every one hurried
within the walls of Athens,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102"
class="fnanchor">[102]</a> carrying with him his movable property
into a state of security. Under the general alarm prevalent, that
the conqueror would march directly into Attica, and under the hurry
of preparation for defence,—the persons both most alarmed and most
in real danger were, of course, Demosthenes, Lykurgus, Charidemus,
and those others who had been loudest in speech against Macedonia,
and had tried to prevail on the Athenians to espouse openly the
cause of Thebes. Yet notwithstanding such terror of consequences
to themselves, the Athenians afforded shelter and sympathy to the
miserable Theban fugitives. They continued to do this even when they
must have known that they were contravening the edict of proscription
just sanctioned by Alexander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>Shortly
afterwards, envoys arrived from that monarch with a menacing
letter, formally demanding the surrender of eight or ten leading
citizens of Athens—Demosthenes, Lykurgus, Hyperides, Polyeuktus,
Mœroklês, Diotimus,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Ephialtes, and Charidemus. Of these
the first four were eminent orators, the last two military men;
all strenuous advocates of an anti-Macedonian policy. Alexander
in his letter denounced the ten as the causes of the battle of
Chæroneia, of the offensive resolutions which had been adopted at
Athens after the death of Philip, and even of the recent hostile
proceedings of the Thebans.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104"
class="fnanchor">[104]</a> This momentous summons, involving the
right of free speech and public debate at Athens, was submitted to
the assembly. A similar demand had just been made upon the Thebans,
and the consequences of refusal were to be read no less plainly in
the destruction of their city than in the threats of the conqueror.
That even under such trying circumstances, neither orators nor
people failed in courage—we know as a general fact; though we have
not the advantage (as Livy had in his time) of reading the speeches
made in the debate.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Demosthenes, insisting that the fate of
the citizens generally could not be severed from that of the specific
victims, is said to have recounted in the course of his speech,
the old fable—of the wolf requiring the sheep to make over to him
their protecting dogs, as a condition of peace—and then, devouring
the unprotected sheep forthwith. He, and those demanded along with
him, claimed the protection of the people,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> in whose cause alone they had incurred
the wrath of the conqueror. Phokion on the other hand—silent at
first, and rising only under constraint by special calls from the
popular voice—contended that there was not force enough to resist
Alexander, and that the persons in question must be given up. He
even made appeal to themselves individually, reminding them of the
self-devotion of the daughters of Erechtheus, memorable in Attic
legend—and calling on them to surrender themselves voluntarily for
the purpose of perverting public calamity He added, that he (Phokion)
would rejoice to offer up either himself, or his best friend, if
by such sacrifice he could save the city.<a id="FNanchor_106"
href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Lykurgus, one of
the orators whose extradition was required, answered this speech
of Phokion with vehemence and bitterness; and the public sentiment
went along with him, indignantly repudiating Phokion’s advice. By
a resolute patriotism highly honorable at this trying juncture, it
was decreed that the persons demanded should not be surrendered.<a
id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>On the motion of Demades, an embassy was sent to Alexander,
deprecating his wrath against the ten, and engaging to punish them
by judicial sentence, if any crime could be proved against them.
Demades, who is said to have received from Demosthenes a bribe of
five talents, undertook this mission. But Alexander was at first
inexorable; refusing even to hear the envoys, and persisting in
his requisition. It was only by the intervention of a second
embassy, headed by Phokion, that a remission of terms was obtained.
Alexander was persuaded to withdraw his requisition, and to be
satisfied with the banishment of Charidemus and Ephialtes, the two
anti-Macedonian military leaders. Both of them accordingly, and
seemingly other Athenians with them, passed into Asia, where they
took service under Darius.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>It was indeed no
part of Alexander’s plan to undertake a siege of Athens, which might
prove long and difficult, since the Athenians had a superior naval
force, with the sea open to them, and the chance of effective support
from Persia. When therefore he saw, that his demand for the ten
orators would be firmly resisted, considerations of policy gradually
overcame his wrath, and induced him to relax.</p>

<p>Phokion returned to Athens as the bearer of Alexander’s
concessions, thus relieving the Athenians from extreme anxiety and
peril. His influence—already great and of long standing, since for
years past he had been perpetually re-elected general—became greater
than ever, while that of Demosthenes and the other anti-Macedonian
orators must have been lowered. It was no mean advantage to
Alexander, victorious as he was, to secure the incorruptible
Phokion as leader of the macedonizing party at Athens. His projects
against Persia were mainly exposed to failure from the possibility
of opposition being raised against him in Greece by the agency of
Persian money and ships. To keep Athens out of such combinations, he
had to rely upon the personal influence and party of Phokion, whom he
knew to have always dissuaded her from resistance to the ever-growing
aggrandizement of his father Philip. In his conversation with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> Phokion on the intended
Asiatic expedition, Alexander took some pains to flatter the pride of
Athens by describing her as second only to himself, and as entitled
to the headship of Greece, in case any thing should happen to him.<a
id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Such compliments were suitable to be repeated in the Athenian
assembly: indeed the Macedonian prince might naturally prefer the
idea of Athenian headship to that of Spartan, seeing that Sparta
stood aloof from him, an open recusant.</p>

<p>The animosity of Alexander being appeased, Athens resumed her
position as a member of the confederacy under his imperial authority.
Without visiting Attica, he now marched to the Isthmus of Corinth,
where he probably received from various Grecian cities deputations
deprecating his displeasure, and proclaiming their submission to
his imperial authority. He also probably presided at a meeting of
the Grecian synod, where he would dictate the contingents required
for his intended Asiatic expedition in the ensuing spring. To
the universal deference and submission which greeted him, one
exception was found—the Cynic philosopher Diogenes, who resided at
Corinth, satisfied with a tub for shelter, and with the coarsest
and most self-denying existence. Alexander approached him with
a numerous suite, and asked him if he wished for anything; upon
which Diogenes is said to have replied,—“Nothing, except that you
would stand a little out of my sunshine.” Both the philosopher and
his reply provoked laughter from the bystanders, but Alexander
himself was so impressed with the independent and self-sufficing
character manifested, that he exclaimed,—“If I were not Alexander,
I would be Diogenes.”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110"
class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Having visited the oracle of Delphi, and received or extorted
from the priestess<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111"
class="fnanchor">[111]</a> an answer bearing favorable promise for
his Asiatic schemes, he returned to Macedonia before the winter.
The most important permanent effect of his stay in Greece was the
reconstitution of Bœotia; that is, the destruction of Thebes, and the
reconstitution of Orchomenus, Thespiæ, and Platæa, dividing between
them the Theban territory; all guarded and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span> controlled by a Macedonian garrison in
the Kadmeia. It would have been interesting to learn some details
about this process of destruction and restitution of the Bœotian
towns; a process not only calling forth strong manifestations of
sentiment, but also involving important and difficult questions to
settle. But unfortunately we are not permitted to know anything
beyond the general fact.</p>

<p>Alexander left Greece for Pella in the autumn of 335
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and never saw it again.</p>

<p>It appears, that during this summer, while he was occupied in
his Illyrian and Theban operations, the Macedonian force under
Parmenio in Asia had had to contend against a Persian army, or Greek
mercenaries, commanded by Memnon the Rhodian. Parmenio, marching into
Æolis, besieged and took Grynium; after which he attacked Pitanê,
but was compelled by Memnon to raise the siege. Memnon even gained
a victory over the Macedonian force under Kallas in the Troad,
compelling them to retire to Rhœteum. But he failed in an attempt to
surprise Kyzikus, and was obliged to content himself with plundering
the adjoining territory.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a> It is affirmed that Darius was engaged
this summer in making large preparations, naval as well as military,
to resist the intended expedition of Alexander. Yet all that we hear
of what was actually done implies nothing beyond a moderate force.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XCII.<br />
    ASIATIC CAMPAIGNS OF ALEXANDER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">A year</span> and some months
had sufficed for Alexander to make a first display of his energy
and military skill, destined for achievements yet greater; and to
crush the growing aspirations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p.
50]</span> for freedom among Greeks on the south, as well as among
Thracians on the north, of Macedonia. The ensuing winter was employed
in completing his preparations; so that early in the spring of 334
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, his army destined for the
conquest of Asia was mustered between Pella and Amphipolis, while his
fleet was at hand to lend support.</p>

<p>The whole of Alexander’s remaining life—from his crossing the
Hellespont in March or April 334 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, to his
death at Babylon in June 323 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, eleven
years and two or three months—was passed in Asia, amidst unceasing
military operations, and ever-multiplied conquests. He never lived
to revisit Macedonia; but his achievements were on so transcendent a
scale, his acquisitions of territory so unmeasured, and his thirst
for farther aggrandizement still so insatiate, that Macedonia sinks
into insignificance in the list of his possessions. Much more do the
Grecian cities dwindle into outlying appendages of a newly-grown
Oriental empire. During all these eleven years, the history of Greece
is almost a blank, except here and there a few scattered events.
It is only at the death of Alexander that the Grecian cities again
awaken into active movement.</p>

<p>The Asiatic conquests of Alexander do not belong directly and
literally to the province of an historian of Greece. They were
achieved by armies of which the general, the principal officers,
and most part of the soldiers, were Macedonian. The Greeks who
served with him were only auxiliaries, along with the Thracians and
Pæonians. Though more numerous than all the other auxiliaries, they
did not constitute, like the Ten Thousand Greeks in the army of the
younger Cyrus, the force on which he mainly relied for victory.
His chief-secretary, Eumenes of Kardia, was a Greek, and probably
most of the civil and intellectual functions connected with the
service were also performed by Greeks. Many Greeks also served
in the army of Persia against him, and composed indeed a larger
proportion of the real force (disregarding mere numbers) in the army
of Darius than in that of Alexander. Hence the expedition becomes
indirectly incorporated with the stream of Grecian history by the
powerful auxiliary agency of Greeks on both sides—and still more,
by its connection with previous projects, dreams, and legends, long
antecedent to the aggrandizement of Macedon—as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span> well as by the character which Alexander
thought fit to assume. To take revenge on Persia for the invasion
of Greece by Xerxes, and to liberate the Asiatic Greeks, had been
the scheme of the Spartan Agesilaus, and of the Pheræan Jason; with
hopes grounded on the memorable expedition and safe return of the
Ten Thousand. It had been recommended by the rhetor Isokrates, first
to the combined force of Greece, while yet Grecian cities were free,
under the joint headship of Athens and Sparta—next, to Philip of
Macedon as the chief of united Greece, when his victorious arms had
extorted a recognition of headship, setting aside both Athens and
Sparta. The enterprising ambition of Philip was well pleased to be
nominated chief of Greece for the execution of this project. From him
it passed to his yet more ambitious son.</p>

<p>Though really a scheme of Macedonian appetite and for Macedonian
aggrandizement, the expedition against Asia thus becomes thrust
into the series of Grecian events, under the Pan-hellenic pretence
of retaliation for the long past insults of Xerxes. I call it a
<i>pretence</i>, because it had ceased to be a real Hellenic feeling, and
served now two different purposes; first, to ennoble the undertaking
in the eyes of Alexander himself, whose mind was very accessible
to religious and legendary sentiment, and who willingly identified
himself with Agamemnon or Achilles, immortalized as executors of the
collective vengeance of Greece for Asiatic insult—next, to assist in
keeping the Greeks quiet during his absence. He was himself aware
that the real sympathies of the Greeks were rather adverse than
favorable to his success.</p>

<p>Apart from this body of extinct sentiment, ostentatiously
rekindled for Alexander’s purposes, the position of the Greeks in
reference to his Asiatic conquests was very much the same as that of
the German contingents, especially those of the Confederation of the
Rhine, who served in the grand army with which the Emperor Napoleon
invaded Russia in 1812. They had no public interest in the victory of
the invader, which could end only by reducing them to still greater
prostration. They were likely to adhere to their leader as long as
his power continued unimpaired, but no longer. Yet Napoleon thought
himself entitled to reckon upon them as if they had been Frenchmen,
and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span> denounce
the Germans in the service of Russia as traitors who had forfeited
the allegiance which they owed to him. We find him drawing the same
pointed distinction between the Russian and the German prisoners
taken, as Alexander made between Asiatic and Grecian prisoners. These
Grecian prisoners the Macedonian prince reproached as guilty of
treason against the proclaimed statute of collective Hellas, whereby
he had been declared general, and the Persian king a public enemy.<a
id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Hellas, as a political aggregate, has now ceased to exist, except
in so far as Alexander employs the name for his own purposes.
Its component members are annexed as appendages, doubtless of
considerable value, to the Macedonian kingdom. Fourteen years before
Alexander’s accession, Demosthenes, while instigating the Athenians
to uphold Olynthus against Philip, had told them<a id="FNanchor_114"
href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>—“The Macedonian
power, considered as an appendage,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span> is of no mean value; but by itself,
it is weak and full of embarrassments.” Inverting the position of
the parties, these words represent exactly what Greece herself
had become, in reference to Macedonia and Persia, at the time of
Alexander’s accession. Had the Persians played their game with
tolerable prudence and vigor, his success would have been measured by
the degree to which he could appropriate Grecian force to himself,
and withhold it from his enemy.</p>

<p>Alexander’s memorable and illustrious manifestations, on which
we are now entering, are those, not of the ruler or politician, but
of the general and the soldier. In this character his appearance
forms a sort of historical epoch. It is not merely in soldier-like
qualities—in the most forward and even adventurous bravery—in
indefatigable personal activity, and in endurance as to hardship
and fatigue,—that he stands pre-eminent; though these qualities
alone, when found in a king, act so powerfully on those under his
command, that they suffice to produce great achievements, even
when combined with generalship not surpassing the average of his
age. But in generalship, Alexander was yet more above the level of
his contemporaries. His strategic combinations, his employment of
different descriptions of force conspiring towards one end, his
long-sighted plans for the prosecution of campaigns, his constant
foresight and resource against new difficulties, together with
rapidity of movement even in the worst country—all on a scale of
prodigious magnitude—are without parallel in ancient history. They
carry the art of systematic and scientific welfare to a degree of
efficiency, such as even successors trained in his school were unable
to keep up unimpaired.</p>

<p>We must recollect however that Alexander found the Macedonian
military system built up by Philip, and had only to apply and enlarge
it. As transmitted to him, it embodied the accumulated result and
matured fruit of a series of successive improvements, applied by
Grecian tacticians to the primitive Hellenic arrangements. During
the sixty years before the accession of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span> Alexander, the art of war had been
conspicuously progressive—to the sad detriment of Grecian political
freedom. “Everything around us (says Demosthenes addressing the
people of Athens in 342 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
has been in advance for some years past—nothing is like what it
was formerly—but nowhere is the alteration and enlargement more
conspicuous than in the affairs of war. Formerly, the Lacedæmonians
as well as other Greeks did nothing more than invade each other’s
territory, during the four or five summer months, with their native
force of citizen hoplites: in winter they stayed at home. But now we
see Philip in constant action, winter as well as summer, attacking
all around him, not merely with Macedonian hoplites, but with
cavalry, light infantry, bowmen, foreigners of all descriptions,
and siege-batteries.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>I have in my last two volumes dwelt upon this progressive change
in the character of Grecian soldiership. At Athens, and in most other
parts of Greece, the burghers had become averse to hard and active
military service. The use of arms had passed mainly to professional
soldiers, who, without any feeling of citizenship, served wherever
good pay was offered, and became immensely multiplied, to the
detriment and danger of Grecian society.<a id="FNanchor_116"
href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Many of these
mercenaries were lightly armed—peltasts served in combination
with the hoplites.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"
class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Iphikrates greatly improved and partly
re-armed the peltasts; whom he employed conjointly with hoplites so
effectively as to astonish his contemporaries.<a id="FNanchor_118"
href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> His innovation was
farther developed by the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p.
55]</span> military genius of Epaminondas; who not only made
infantry and cavalry, light-armed and heavy-armed, conspire to one
scheme of operations, but also completely altered the received
principles of battle-manœuvring, by concentrating an irresistible
force of attack on one point of the enemy’s line, and keeping the
rest of his own line more on the defensive. Besides these important
improvements, realized by generals in actual practice, intelligent
officers like Xenophon embodied the results of their military
experience in valuable published criticisms.<a id="FNanchor_119"
href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Such were the lessons
which the Macedonian Philip learnt and applied to the enslavement of
those Greeks, especially of the Thebans, from whom they were derived.
In his youth, as a hostage at Thebes, he had probably conversed
with Epaminondas, and must certainly have become familiar with the
Theban military arrangements. He had every motive, not merely from
ambition, of conquest, but even from the necessities of defence, to
turn them to account: and he brought to the task military genius and
aptitude of the highest order. In arms, in evolutions, in engines,
in regimenting, in war-office arrangements, he introduced important
novelties; bequeathing to his successors the Macedonian military
system, which, with improvements by his son, lasted until the
conquest of the country by Rome, near two centuries afterwards.</p>

<p>The military force of Macedonia, in the times anterior to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span> Philip, appears to have
consisted, like that of Thessaly, in a well-armed and well-mounted
cavalry, formed from the substantial proprietors of the country—and
in a numerous assemblage of peltasts or light infantry (somewhat
analogous to the Thessalian Penestæ): these latter were the rural
population, shepherds or cultivators, who tended sheep and cattle, or
tilled the earth, among the spacious mountains and valleys of Upper
Macedonia. The Grecian towns near the coast, and the few Macedonian
towns in the interior, had citizen-hoplites better armed; but
foot-service was not in honor among the natives, and the Macedonian
infantry in their general character were hardly more than a rabble.
At the period of Philip’s accession, they were armed with nothing
better than rusty swords and wicker shields, noway sufficient to make
head against the inroads of their Thracian and Illyrian neighbors;
before whom they were constantly compelled to flee for refuge
up into the mountains.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Their condition was that of a poor
herdsman, half-naked or covered only with hides, and eating from
wooden platters: not much different from that of the population
of Upper Macedonia three centuries before, when first visited by
Perdikkas the ancestor of the Macedonian kings, and when the wife of
the native prince baked bread with her own hands.<a id="FNanchor_121"
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> On the other hand,
though the Macedonian infantry was thus indifferent, the cavalry of
the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> was
excellent, both in the Peloponnesian war, and in the war carried
on by Sparta against Olynthus more than twenty years afterwards.<a
id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
These horsemen, like the Thessalians, charged in compact order,
carrying as their principal weapon of offence, not javelins to be
hurled, but the short thrusting-pike for close combat.</p>

<p>Thus defective was the military organization which Philip found.
Under his auspices it was cast altogether anew. The poor and hardy
Landwehr of Macedonia, constantly on the defensive against predatory
neighbors, formed an excellent material for soldiers, and proved
not intractable to the innovations of a warlike prince. They were
placed under constant training in the regular rank and file of heavy
infantry: they were moreover brought to adopt a new description
of arm, not only in itself very difficult to manage, but also
comparatively useless to the soldier when fighting single-handed,
and only available by a body of men in close order, trained to
move or stand together. The new weapon, of which we first hear the
name in the army of Philip, was the sarissa—the Macedonian pike or
lance. The sarissa was used both by the infantry of his phalanx,
and by particular regiments of his cavalry; in both cases it was
long, though that of the phalanx was much the longer of the two.
The regiments of cavalry called Sarissophori or Lancers were a sort
of light-horse, carrying a long lance, and distinguished from the
heavier cavalry intended for the shock of hand combat, who carried
the xyston or short pike. The sarissa of this cavalry may have been
fourteen feet in length, as long as the Cossack pike now is; that of
the infantry in phalanx was not less than twenty-one feet long. This
dimension is so prodigious and so unwieldy, that we should hardly
believe it, if it did not come attested by the distinct assertion of
an historian like Polybius.</p>

<p>The extraordinary reach of the sarissa or pike constituted
the prominent attribute and force of the Macedonian phalanx. The
phalangites were drawn up in files generally sixteen deep, each
called a Lochus; with an interval of three feet between each two
soldiers from front to rear. In front stood the lochage, a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span> man of superior strength,
and of tried military experience. The second and third men in the
file, as well as the rearmost man who brought up the whole, were also
picked soldiers, receiving larger pay than the rest. Now the sarissa,
when in horizontal position, was held with both hands (distinguished
in this respect from the pike of the Grecian hoplite, which occupied
only one hand, the other being required for the shield), and so held
that it projected fifteen feet before the body of the pikeman; while
the hinder portion of six feet so weighted as to make the pressure
convenient in such division. Hence, the sarissa of the man standing
second in the file, projected twelve feet beyond the front rank;
that of the third man, nine feet; these of the fourth and fifth
ranks, respectively six feet and three feet. There was thus presented
a quintuple series of pikes by each file, to meet an advancing
enemy. Of these five, the three first would be decidedly of greater
projection, and even the fourth of not less projection, than the
pikes of Grecian hoplites coming up as enemies to the charge. The
ranks behind the fifth, while serving to sustain and press onward
the front, did not carry the sarissa in a horizontal position, but
slanted it over the shoulders of those before them, so as to break
the force of any darts or arrows which might be shot over head from
the rear ranks of the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The phalangite (soldier of the phalanx) was farther provided
with a short sword, a circular shield of rather more than two
feet in diameter, a breast-piece, leggings, and a kausia or
broad-brimmed-hat—the head-covering common in the Macedonian army.
But the long pikes were in truth the main weapons of defence as well
as of offence. They were destined to contend against the charge
of Grecian hoplites with the one-handed pike and heavy shield;
especially against the most formidable manifestation of that force,
the deep Theban column organized by Epaminondas. This was what Philip
had to deal with, at his accession, as the irresistible infantry
of Greece, bearing down everything before it by thrust of pike and
propulsion of shield. He provided the means of vanquishing it,
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span> training his
poor Macedonian infantry to the systematic use of the long two-handed
pike. The Theban column, charging a phalanx so armed, found
themselves unable to break into the array of protended pikes, or to
come to push of shield. We are told that at the battle of Chæroneia,
the front rank Theban soldiers, the chosen men of the city, all
perished on the ground; and this is not wonderful, when we conceive
them as rushing, by their own courage as well as by the pressure upon
them from behind, upon a wall of Pikes double the length of their
own. We must look at Philip’s phalanx with reference to the enemies
before him, not with reference to the later Roman organization,
which Polybius brings into comparison. It answered perfectly the
purposes of Philip, who wanted mainly to stand the shock in front,
thus overpowering Grecian hoplites in their own mode of attack. Now
Polybius informs us, that the phalanx was never once beaten, in front
and on ground suitable for it; and wherever the ground was fit for
hoplites, it was also fit for the phalanx. The inconveniences of
Philip’s array, and of the long pikes, arose from the incapacity of
the phalanx to change its front or keep its order on unequal ground;
but such inconveniences were hardly less felt by Grecian hoplites.<a
id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The Macedonian phalanx, denominated the Pezetæri<a
id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
or Foot Companions of the King, comprised the general body of
native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span> infantry,
as distinguished from special <i>corps d’armée</i>. The largest division
of it which we find mentioned under Alexander, and which appears
under the command of a general of division, is called a Taxis. How
many of these Taxeis there were in all, we do not know; the original
Asiatic army of Alexander (apart from what he left at home) included
six of them, coinciding apparently with the provincial allotments
of the country: Orestæ, Lynkestæ, Elimiotæ, Tymphæi, etc.<a
id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
The writers on tactics give us a systematic scale of distribution
(ascending from the lowest unit, the Lochus of sixteen men, by
successive multiples of two, up to the quadruple phalanx of 16,384
men) as pervading the Macedonian army. Among these divisions,
that which stands out as most fundamental and constant, is the
Syntagma, which contained sixteen Lochi. Forming thus a square of
sixteen men in front and depth, or 256 men, it was at the same
time a distinct aggregate or permanent battalion, having attached
to it five supernumeraries, an ensign, a rear-man, a trumpeter,
a herald, and an attendant or orderly.<a id="FNanchor_127"
href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Two of these
Syntagmas composed a body of 512 men, called a Pentakosiarchy,
which in Philip’s time is said to have been the ordinary regiment,
acting together under a separate command; but several of these
were doubled by Alexander when he reorganized his army at Susa,<a
id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
so as to form regiments of 1024 men, each under its Chiliarch, and
each comprising four Syntagmas. All this systematic distribution
of the Macedonian military force when at home, appears to have
been arranged by the genius of Philip. On actual foreign service,
no numerical precision could be observed; a regiment or a division
could not always contain the same fixed num<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>ber of men. But as to the array, a depth
of sixteen, for the files of the phalangites, appears to have been
regarded as important and characteristic,<a id="FNanchor_129"
href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> perhaps essential to
impart a feeling of confidence to the troops. It was a depth much
greater than was common with Grecian hoplites, and never surpassed by
any Greeks except the Thebans.</p>

<p>But the phalanx, though an essential item, was yet only one among
many, in the varied military organization introduced by Philip. It
was neither intended, nor fit, to act alone; being clumsy in changing
front to protect itself either in flank or rear, and unable to adapt
itself to uneven ground. There was another description of infantry
organized by Philip called the Hypaspists—shield-bearers or Guards;<a
id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
originally few in number, and employed for personal defence of the
prince—but afterwards enlarged into several distinct <i>corps d’armée</i>.
These Hypaspists or Guards were light infantry of the line;<a
id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
they were hoplites, keeping regular array and intended for close
combat, but more lightly armed, and more fit for diversities of
circumstance and position, than the phalanx. They seem to have
fought with the one-handed pike and shield, like the Greeks; and
not to have carried the two-handed phalangite pike or sarissa. They
occupied a sort of intermediate place between the heavy infantry of
the phalanx properly so called—and the peltasts and light troops
generally. Alexander in his later campaigns had them distributed
into Chiliarchies (how the distribution stood earlier, we have no
distinct information), at least three in number, and probably more.<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
We find them employed by him in forward<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span> and aggressive movements; first his
light troops and cavalry begin the attack; next, the hypaspists
come to follow it up; lastly, the phalanx is brought up to support
them. The hypaspists are used also for assault of walled places, and
for rapid night marches.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133"
class="fnanchor">[133]</a> What was the total number of them,
we do not know.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"
class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Besides the phalanx, and the hypaspists or Guards, the
Macedonian army as employed by Philip and Alexander included a
numerous assemblage of desultory or irregular troops, partly native
Macedonians, partly foreigners, Thracians, Pæonians, etc. They were
of different descriptions; peltasts, darters, and bowmen. The best
of them appear to have been the Agriânes, a Pæonian tribe expert in
the use of the javelin. All of them were kept in vigorous movement
by Alexander, on the flanks and in front of his heavy infantry, or
intermingled with his cavalry,—as well as for pursuit after the enemy
was defeated.</p>

<p>Lastly, the cavalry in Alexander’s army was also admirable—at
least equal, and seemingly even superior in efficiency, to
his best infantry.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> I have already mentioned that cavalry
was the choice native force of Macedonia, long before the
reign of Philip; by whom it had been extended and improved.<a
id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
The heavy cavalry, wholly or chiefly composed of native Macedonians,
was known by the denomination of the Companions. There was besides
a new and lighter variety of cavalry, apparently introduced by
Philip, and called the Sarissophori, or Lancers, used like Cossacks
for advanced posts or scouring the country. The sarissa which they
carried was probably much shorter than that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span> of the phalanx; but it was long, if
compared with the xyston or thrusting pike used by the heavy cavalry
for the shock of close combat. Arrian, in describing the army of
Alexander at Arbêla, enumerates eight distinct squadrons of this
heavy cavalry—or cavalry of the Companions; but the total number
included in the Macedonian army at Alexander’s accession, is not
known. Among the squadrons, several at least (if not all) were
named after particular towns or districts of the country—Bottiæa,
Amphipolis, Apollonia, Anthemus, etc.;<a id="FNanchor_137"
href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> there was one or
more, distinguished as the Royal Squadron—the Agêma or leading body
of cavalry—at the head of which Alexander generally charged, himself
among the foremost of the actual combatants.<a id="FNanchor_138"
href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The distribution of the cavalry into squadrons was that
which Alexander found at his accession; but he altered it,
when he remodelled the arrangements of his army (in 330
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), at Susa, so as to subdivide the
squadron into two Lochi, and to establish the Lochus for the
elementary division of cavalry, as it had always been of infantry.<a
id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> His
reforms went thus to cut down the primary body of cavalry from the
squadron to the half-squadron or Lochus, while they tended to bring
the infantry together into larger bodies—from cohorts of 500 each to
cohorts of 1000 men each.</p>

<p>Among the Hypaspists or Guards, also, we find an Agêma or chosen
cohort, which was called upon oftener than the rest to begin the
fight. A still more select corps were, the Body-Guards; a small
company of tried and confidential men, individ<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>ually known to Alexander, always attached
to his person, and acting as adjutants or as commanders for special
service. These Body-Guards appear to have been chosen persons
promoted out of the Royal Youths or Pages; an institution first
established by Philip, and evincing the pains taken by him to bring
the leading Macedonians into military organization as well as into
dependence on his own person. The Royal Youths, sons of the chief
persons throughout Macedonia, were taken by Philip into service,
and kept in permanent residence around him for purposes of domestic
attendance and companionship. They maintained perpetual guard of
his palace, alternating among themselves the hours of daily and
nightly watch; they received his horse from the grooms, assisted
him to mount, and accompanied him if he went to the chase: they
introduced persons who came to solicit interviews, and admitted
his mistresses by night through a special door. They enjoyed the
privilege of sitting down to dinner with him, as well as that of
never being flogged except by his special order.<a id="FNanchor_140"
href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> The precise number
of the company we do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p.
65]</span> know; but it must have been not small, since fifty of
these youths were brought out from Macedonia at once by Amyntas
to join Alexander and to be added to the company at Babylon.<a
id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> At
the same time the mortality among them was probably considerable;
since, in accompanying Alexander, they endured even more than
the prodigious fatigues which he imposed upon himself.<a
id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
The training in this corps was a preparation first for becoming
Body-guards of Alexander,—next, for appointment to the great and
important military commands. Accordingly, it had been the first
stage of advancement to most of the Diadochi, or great officers of
Alexander, who after his death carved kingdoms for themselves out of
his conquests.</p>

<p>It was thus that the native Macedonian force was enlarged and
diversified by Philip, including at his death—1. The phalanx,
Foot-companions, or general mass of heavy infantry, drilled to
the use of the long two-handed pike or sarissa—2. The Hypaspists,
or lighter-armed corps of foot-guards—3. The Companions, or heavy
cavalry, the ancient indigenous force consisting of the more opulent
or substantial Macedonians—4. The lighter cavalry, lancers, or
Sarissophori.—With these were joined foreign auxiliaries of great
value. The Thessalians, whom Philip had partly subjugated and
partly gained over, furnished him with a body of heavy cavalry not
inferior to the native Macedonian. From various parts of Greece he
derived hoplites, volunteers taken into his pay, armed with the
full-sized shield and one-handed pike. From the warlike tribes of
Thracians, Pæonians, Illyrians, etc., whom he had subdued around
him, he levied contingents of light troops of various descriptions,
peltasts, bowmen, darters, etc., all excellent in their way, and
eminently serviceable to his combinations, in conjunction with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> the heavier masses.
Lastly, Philip had completed his military arrangements by organizing
what may be called an effective siege-train for sieges as well as
for battles; a stock of projectile and battering machines, superior
to anything at that time extant. We find this artillery used by
Alexander in the very first year of his reign, in his campaign
against the Illyrians.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143"
class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Even in his most distant Indian marches,
he either carried it with him, or had the means of constructing new
engines for the occasion. There was no part of his military equipment
more essential to his conquests. The victorious sieges of Alexander
are among his most memorable exploits.</p>

<p>To all this large, multifarious, and systematized array of
actual force, are to be added the civil establishments, the depôts,
magazines of arms, provision for remounts, drill officers and
adjutants, etc., indispensable for maintaining it in constant
training and efficiency. At the time of Philip’s accession, Pella
was an unimportant place;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144"
class="fnanchor">[144]</a> at his death, it was not only strong as
a fortification and place of deposit for regal treasure, but also
the permanent centre, war-office, and training quarters, of the
greatest military force then known. The military registers as well as
the traditions of Macedonian discipline were preserved there until
the fall of the monarchy.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145"
class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Philip had employed his life in organizing
this powerful instrument of dominion. His revenues, large as they
were, both from mines and from tributary conquests, had been
exhausted in the work, so that he had left at his decease a debt
of 500 talents. But his son Alexander found the instrument ready
made, with excellent officers, and trained veterans for the front
ranks of his phalanx.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>This scientific organization of military force, on a large scale
and with all the varieties of arming and equipment made to co<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span>-operate for one end, is
the great fact of Macedonian history. Nothing of the same kind and
magnitude had ever before been seen. The Macedonians, like Epirots
and Ætolians, had no other aptitude or marking quality except
those of soldiership. Their rude and scattered tribes manifest no
definite political institutions and little sentiment of national
brotherhood; their union was mainly that of occasional fellowship
in arms under the king as chief. Philip the son of Amyntas was the
first to organize this military union into a system permanently and
efficaciously operative, achieving by means of it conquests such as
to create in the Macedonians a common pride of superiority in arms,
which served as substitute for political institutions or nationality.
Such pride was still farther exalted by the really superhuman career
of Alexander. The Macedonian kingdom was nothing but a well-combined
military machine, illustrating the irresistible superiority of the
rudest men, trained in arms and conducted by an able general, not
merely over undisciplined multitudes, but also over free, courageous,
and disciplined, citizenship with highly gifted intelligence.</p>

<p>During the winter of 335-334 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, after the
destruction of Thebes and the return of Alexander from Greece to
Pella, his final preparations were made for the Asiatic expedition.
The Macedonian army with the auxiliary contingents destined for this
enterprise were brought together early in the spring. Antipater, one
of the oldest and ablest officers of Philip, was appointed to act as
viceroy of Macedonia during the king’s absence. A military force,
stated at 12,000 infantry and 1500 cavalry,<a id="FNanchor_147"
href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> was left with him
to keep down the cities of Greece, to resist aggressions from the
Persian fleet, and to repress discontents at home. Such discontents
were likely to be instigated by leading Macedonians or pretenders
to the throne, especially as Alexander had no direct heir: and
we are told that Antipater and Parmenio advised postponement of
the expedition until the young king could leave behind him an
heir of his own lineage.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148"
class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Alexander overruled these representations;
yet he did not disdain to lessen the perils at home by putting
to death such men as he principally<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span> feared or mistrusted, especially the
kinsmen of Philip’s last wife Kleopatra.<a id="FNanchor_149"
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Of the dependent
tribes around, the most energetic chiefs accompanied his army into
Asia, either by their own preference or at his requisition. After
these precautions, the tranquillity of Macedonia was entrusted
to the prudence and fidelity of Antipater, which were still
farther ensured by the fact that three of his sons accompanied the
king’s army and person.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Though unpopular in his deportment,<a
id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Antipater discharged the duties of his very responsible position
with zeal and ability; notwithstanding the dangerous enmity of
Olympias, against whom he sent many complaints to Alexander when in
Asia, whilst she on her side wrote frequent but unavailing letters
with a view to ruin him in the esteem of her son. After a long
period of unabated confidence, Alexander began during the last years
of his life to dislike and mistrust Antipater. He always treated
Olym<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>pias with
the greatest respect; trying however to restrain her from meddling
with political affairs, and complaining sometimes of her imperious
exigencies and violence.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152"
class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The army intended for Asia, having been assembled at Pella,
was conducted by Alexander himself first to Amphipolis, where it
crossed the Strymon; next along the road near the coast to the river
Nestus and to the towns of Abdêra and Maroneia; then through Thrace
across the rivers Hebrus and Melas; lastly, through the Thracian
Chersonese to Sestos. Here it was met by his fleet, consisting
of 160 triremes, with a number of trading vessels besides;<a
id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
made up in large proportions from contingents furnished by Athens
and Grecian cities.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154"
class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The passage of the whole army, infantry,
cavalry, and machines, on ships, across the strait from Sestos
in Europe to Abydos in Asia,—was superintended by Parmenio, and
accomplished without either difficulty or resistance. But Alexander
himself, separating from the army at Sestos, went down to Elæus at
the southern extremity of the Chersonese. Here stood the chapel and
sacred precinct of the hero Protesilaus, who was slain by Hektor;
having been the first Greek (according to the legend of the Trojan
war) who touched the shore of Troy. Alexander, whose imagination
was then full of Homeric reminiscences, offered sacrifice to the
hero, praying that his own disembarkation might terminate more
auspiciously.</p>

<p>He then sailed across in the admiral’s trireme, steering with
his own hand, to the landing place near Ilium called the Harbor
of the Achæans. At mid-channel of the strait, he sacrificed a
bull, with libations out of a golden goblet, to Poseidon and the
Nereids. Himself too in full armor, he was the first (like Pro<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span>tesilaus) to tread the
Asiatic shore; but he found no enemy like Hektor to meet him. From
hence, mounting the hill on which Ilium was placed, he sacrificed
to the patron-goddess Athênê; and deposited in her temple his own
panoply, taking in exchange some of the arms said to have been worn
by the heroes in the Trojan war, which he caused to be carried by
guards along with him in his subsequent battles. Among other real or
supposed monuments of this interesting legend, the Ilians showed to
him the residence of Priam with its altar of Zeus Herkeios, where
that unhappy old king was alleged to have been slain by Neoptolemus.
Numbering Neoptolemus among his ancestors, Alexander felt himself
to be the object of Priam’s yet unappeased wrath; and accordingly
offered sacrifice to him at the same altar, for the purpose of
expiation and reconciliation. On the tomb and monumental column of
Achilles, father of Neoptolemus, he not only placed a decorative
garland, but also went through the customary ceremony of anointing
himself with oil and running naked round it: exclaiming how much
he envied the lot of Achilles, who had been blest during life with
a faithful friend, and after death, with a great poet to celebrate
his exploits. Lastly, to commemorate his crossing, Alexander erected
permanent altars, in honor of Zeus, Athênê, and Hêraklês; both on
the point of Europe which his army had quitted, and on that of
Asia where it had landed.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span>The proceedings
of Alexander, on the ever-memorable site of Ilium, are interesting
as they reveal one side of his imposing character—the vein of
legendary sympathy and religious sentiment wherein alone consisted
his analogy with the Greeks. The young Macedonian prince had
nothing of that sense of correlative right and obligation, which
characterized the free Greeks of the city-community. But he was in
many points a reproduction of the heroic Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_156"
href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> his warlike ancestors
in legend, Achilles and Neoptolemus, and others of that Æakid race,
unparalleled in the attributes of force—a man of violent impulse
in all directions, sometimes generous, often vindictive—ardent in
his individual affections both of love and hatred, but devoured
especially by an inextinguishable pugnacity, appetite for conquest,
and thirst for establishing at all cost his superiority of force over
others—“Jura negat sibi nata, nihil non arrogat armis”—taking pride,
not simply in victorious generalship and direction of the arms of
soldiers, but also in the personal forwardness of an Homeric chief,
the foremost to encounter both danger and hardship. To dispositions
resembling those of Achilles, Alexander indeed added one attribute
of a far higher order. As a general, he surpassed his age in
provident and even long-sighted combinations. With all his exuberant
courage and sanguine temper, nothing was ever omitted in the way of
systematic military precaution. Thus much be borrowed, though with
many improvements of his own, from Grecian intelligence as applied
to soldiership. But the character and dispositions, which he took
with him to Asia, had the features, both striking and repulsive, of
Achilles, rather than those of Agesilaus or Epaminondas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span>The army, when
reviewed on the Asiatic shore after its crossing, presented a total
of 30,000 infantry, and 4500 cavalry, thus distributed:—</p>

<p class="mt1">Such seems the most trustworthy enumeration
of Alexander’s first invading army. There were however other
accounts, the highest of which stated as much as 43,000 infantry
with 4000 cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157"
class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Besides these troops, also, there must
have been an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span>
effective train of projectile machines and engines, for battles and
sieges, which we shall soon find in operation. As to money, the
military chest of Alexander, exhausted in part by profuse donatives
to his Macedonian officers,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158"
class="fnanchor">[158]</a> was as poorly furnished as that of
Napoleon Buonaparte on first entering Italy for his brilliant
campaign of 1796. According to Aristobulus, he had with him only
seventy talents; according to another authority, no more than the
means of maintaining his army for thirty days. Nor had he even been
able to bring together his auxiliaries, or complete the outfit of his
army, without incurring a debt of 800 talents, in addition to that
of 500 talents contracted by his father Philip.<a id="FNanchor_159"
href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Though Plutarch<a
id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
wonders at the smallness of the force with which Alexander
contemplated the execution of such great projects, yet the fact
is, that in infantry he was far above any force which the Persians
had to oppose him;<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161"
class="fnanchor">[161]</a> not to speak of comparative discipline
and organization, surpassing even that of the Grecian mercenaries,
who formed the only good infantry in the Persian service; while his
cavalry, though inferior as to number, was superior in quality and in
the shock of close combat.</p>

<p>Most of the officers exercising important command in Alexander’s
army were native Macedonians. His intimate personal friend
Hephæstion, as well as his body-guards Leonnatus and Lysimachus,
were natives of Pella: Ptolemy the son of Lagus, and Pithon, were
Eordians from Upper Macedonia; Kraterus and Perdikkas, from the
district of Upper Macedonia called Orestis;<a id="FNanchor_162"
href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Antipater with
his son Kassander, Kleitus son of Drôpides, Parmenio with his two
sons Philôtas and Nikanor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p.
74]</span> Seleukus, Kœnus, Amyntas, Philippus (these two last names
were borne by more than one person), Antigonus, Neoptolemus,<a
id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
Meleager, Peukestes, etc., all these seem to have been native
Macedonians. All or most of them had been trained to war under
Philip, in whose service Parmenio and Antipater, especially, had
occupied a high rank.</p>

<p>Of the many Greeks in Alexander’s service, we hear of few in
important station. Medius, a Thessalian from Larissa, was among
his familiar companions; but the ablest and most distinguished of
all was Eumenes, a native of Kardia in the Thracian Chersonese.
Eumenes, combining an excellent Grecian education with bodily
activity and enterprise, had attracted when a young man the notice
of Philip and had been appointed as his secretary. After discharging
these duties for seven years until the death of Philip, he was
continued by Alexander in the post of chief secretary during the
whole of that king’s life.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164"
class="fnanchor">[164]</a> He conducted most of Alexander’s
correspondence, and the daily record of his proceedings, which was
kept under the name of the Royal Ephemerides. But though his special
duties were thus of a civil character, he was not less eminent as
an officer in the field. Occasionally entrusted with high military
command, he received from Alexander signal recompenses and tokens of
esteem. In spite of these great qualities—or perhaps in consequence
of them—he was the object of marked jealousy and dislike<a
id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
on the part of the Macedonians,—from Hephæstion the friend, and
Neoptolemus the chief armor-bearer, of Alexander, down to the
principal soldiers of the phalanx. Neoptolemus despised Eumenes as an
unwarlike penman. The contemptuous pride with which Macedonians had
now come to look down on Greeks, is a notable characteristic of the
victorious army of Alexander, as well as a new feature in history;
retorting the ancient Hellenic sentiment in which Demosthenes,
a few years before, had indulged towards the Macedonians.<a
id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>Though Alexander
has been allowed to land in Asia unopposed, an army was already
assembled under the Persian satraps within a few days’ march of
Abydos. Since the reconquest of Egypt and Phenicia, about eight or
nine years before, by the Persian king Ochus, the power of that
empire had been restored to a point equal to any anterior epoch since
the repulse of Xerxes from Greece. The Persian successes in Egypt
had been achieved mainly by the arms of Greek mercenaries, under the
conduct and through the craft of the Rhodian general Mentor; who,
being seconded by the preponderant influence of the eunuch Bagôas,
confidential minister of Ochus, obtained not only ample presents,
but also the appointment of military commander on the Hellespont
and the Asiatic seaboard.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a> He procured the recall of his brother
Memnon, who with his brother-in-law Artabazus had been obliged to
leave Asia from unsuccessful revolt against the Persians, and had
found shelter with Philip.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168"
class="fnanchor">[168]</a> He farther subdued, by force or by fraud,
various Greek and Asiatic chieftains on the Asiatic coast; among
them, the distinguished Hermeias, friend of Aristotle, and master of
the strong post of Atarneus.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169"
class="fnanchor">[169]</a> These successes of Mentor seem to have
occurred about 343 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> He, and his
brother Memnon after him, upheld vigorously the authority of the
Persian king in the regions near the Hellespont. It was probably
by them that troops were sent across the strait both to rescue the
besieged town of Perinthus from Philip, and to act against that
prince in other parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p.
76]</span> Thrace;<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a> that an Asiatic chief, who was intriguing
to facilitate Philip’s intended invasion of Asia, was seized and
sent prisoner to the Persian court; and that envoys from Athens,
soliciting aid against Philip, were forwarded to the same place.<a
id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Ochus, though successful in regaining the full extent of
Persian dominion, was a sanguinary tyrant, who shed by wholesale
the blood of his family and courtiers. About the year 338
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, he died, poisoned by the eunuch Bagôas,
who placed upon the throne Arses, one of the king’s sons, killing
all the rest. After two years, however, Bagôas conceived mistrust of
Arses, and put him to death also, together with all his children;
thus leaving no direct descendant of the regal family alive. He then
exalted to the throne one of his friends named Darius Codomannus
(descended from one of the brothers of Artaxerxes Memnon), who
had acquired glory, in a recent war against the Kadusians, by
killing in single combat a formidable champion of the enemy’s
army. Presently, however, Bagôas attempted to poison Darius also;
but the latter, detecting the snare, forced him to drink the
deadly draught himself.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a> In spite of such murders and change in the
line of succession, which Alexander afterwards reproached to Darius<a
id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>—the
authority of Darius seems to have been recognized, without any
material opposition, throughout all the Persian empire.</p>

<p>Succeeding to the throne in the early part of
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 336, when Philip was organizing the
projected invasion of Persia, and when the first Macedonian
division under Parmenio and Attalus was already making war in
Asia—Darius prepared measures of defence at home, and tried to
encourage anti-Macedonian movements in Greece.<a id="FNanchor_174"
href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> On the assassination
of Philip by Pausanias, the Persian king publicly proclaimed himself
(probably untruly) as having instigated the deed, and alluded in
contemptuous terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span>
to the youthful Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"
class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Conceiving the danger from Macedonia
to be past, he imprudently slackened his efforts and withheld his
supplies during the first months of Alexander’s reign, when the
latter might have been seriously embarrassed in Greece and in
Europe by the effective employment of Persian ships and money. But
the recent successes of Alexander in Thrace, Illyria, and Bœotia,
satisfied Darius that the danger was not past, so that he resumed
his preparations for defence. The Phenician fleet was ordered
to be equipped: the satraps in Phrygia and Lydia got together a
considerable force, consisting in part of Grecian mercenaries; while
Memnon, on the seaboard, was furnished with the means of taking 5000
of these mercenaries under his separate command.<a id="FNanchor_176"
href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>We cannot trace with any exactness the course of these events,
during the nineteen months between Alexander’s accession and his
landing in Asia (August 336 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
to March or April 334 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) We
learn generally that Memnon was active and even aggressive on
the north-eastern coast of the Ægean. Marching northward from
his own territory (the region of Assus or Atarneus skirting the
Gulf of Adramyttium<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177"
class="fnanchor">[177]</a>) across the range of Mount Ida, he came
suddenly upon the town of Kyzikus on the Propontis. He failed,
however, though only by a little, in his attempt to surprise
it, and was forced to content himself with a rich booty from
the district around.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178"
class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The Macedonian generals Parmenio and
Kallas had crossed into Asia with bodies of troops. Parmenio,
acting in Æolis, took Grynium, but was compelled by Memnon to raise
the siege of Pitanê; while Kallas, in the Troad, was attacked,
defeated, and compelled to retire to Rhœteium.<a id="FNanchor_179"
href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>We thus see that during the season preceding the landing of
Alexander, the Persians were in considerable force, and Mem<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>non both active and
successful even against the Macedonian generals, on the region
north-east of the Ægean. This may help to explain that fatal
imprudence, whereby the Persians permitted Alexander to carry over
without opposition his grand army into Asia, in the spring of 334
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> They possessed ample means of
guarding the Hellespont, had they chosen to bring up their fleet,
which, comprising as it did the force of the Phenician towns,
was decidedly superior to any naval armament at the disposal of
Alexander. The Persian fleet actually came into the Ægean a few weeks
afterwards. Now Alexander’s designs, preparations, and even intended
time of march, must have been well known not merely to Memnon, but
to the Persian satraps in Asia Minor, who had got together troops to
oppose him. These satraps unfortunately supposed themselves to be a
match for him in the field, disregarding the pronounced opinion of
Memnon to the contrary, and even overruling his prudent advice by
mistrustful and calumnious imputations.</p>

<p>At the time of Alexander’s landing, a powerful Persian force
was already assembled near Zeleia in the Hellespontine Phrygia,
under command of Arsites the Phrygian satrap, supported by several
other leading Persians—Spithridates (satrap of Lydia and Ionia),
Pharnakes, Atizyes, Mithridates, Rhomithres, Niphates, Petines,
etc. Forty of these men were of high rank (denominated kinsmen of
Darius), and distinguished for personal valor. The greater number
of the army consisted of cavalry, including Medes, Baktrians,
Hyrkanians, Kappadokians, Paphlagonians, etc.<a id="FNanchor_180"
href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> In cavalry they
greatly outnumbered Alexander; but their infantry was much
inferior in number,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181"
class="fnanchor">[181]</a> composed however, in large proportion, of
Grecian mercenaries. The Persian total is given by Arrian as 20,000
cavalry, and nearly 20,000 mercenary foot; by Diodorus as 10,000
cavalry, and 100,000 infantry; by Justin even at 600,000. The numbers
of Arrian are the more credible; in those of Diodorus, the total of
infantry is certainly much above the truth—that of cavalry probably
below it.</p>

<p>Memnon, who was present with his sons and with his own<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span> division, earnestly
dissuaded the Persian leaders from hazarding a battle. Reminding
them that the Macedonians were not only much superior in infantry,
but also encouraged by the leadership of Alexander—he enforced the
necessity of employing their numerous cavalry to destroy the forage
and provisions, and if necessary, even towns themselves—in order to
render any considerable advance of the invading force impracticable.
While keeping strictly on the defensive in Asia, he recommended that
aggressive war should be carried into Macedonia; that the fleet
should be brought up, a powerful land-force put aboard, and strenuous
efforts made, not only to attack the vulnerable points of Alexander
at home, but also to encourage active hostility against him from the
Greeks and other neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182"
class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Had this plan been energetically executed by Persian arms and
money, we can hardly doubt that Antipater in Macedonia would speedily
have found himself pressed by serious dangers and embarrassments,
and that Alexander would have been forced to come back and protect
his own dominions; perhaps prevented by the Persian fleet from
bringing back his whole army. At any rate, his schemes of Asiatic
invasion must for the time have been suspended. But he was rescued
from this dilemma by the ignorance, pride, and pecuniary interests
of the Persian leaders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p.
80]</span> Unable to appreciate Alexander’s military superiority,
and conscious at the same time of their own personal bravery, they
repudiated the proposition of retreat as dishonorable, insinuating
that Memnon desired to prolong the war in order to exalt his own
importance in the eyes of Darius. This sentiment of military dignity
was farther strengthened by the fact, that the Persian military
leaders, deriving all their revenues from the land, would have been
impoverished by destroying the landed produce. Arsites, in whose
territory the army stood, and upon whom the scheme would first
take effect, haughtily announced that he would not permit a single
house in it to be burnt.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183"
class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Occupying the same satrapy as Pharnabazus
had possessed sixty years before, he felt that he would be reduced to
the same straits as Pharnabazus under the pressure of Agesilaus—“of
not being able to procure a dinner in his own country”.<a
id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The
proposition of Memnon was rejected, and it was resolved to await the
arrival of Alexander on the banks of the river Granikus.</p>

<p>This unimportant stream, commemorated in the Iliad, and
immortalized by its association with the name of Alexander, takes
its rise from one of the heights of Mount Ida near Skêpsis,<a
id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
and flows northward into the Propontis, which it reaches at a
point somewhat east of the Greek town of Parium. It is of no great
depth: near the point where the Persians encamped, it seems to have
been fordable in many places; but its right bank was somewhat high
and steep, thus offering obstruction to an enemy’s attack. The
Persians, marching forward from Zeleia, took up a position near the
eastern side of the Granikus, where the last declivities of Mount
Ida descend into the plain of Adrasteia, a Greek city situated
between Priapus and Parium.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186"
class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Alexander marched onward towards this position,
from Arisbê (where he had reviewed his army)—on the first<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> day to Perkôtê, on the
second to the river Praktius, on the third to Hermôtus; receiving
on his way the spontaneous surrender of the town of Priapus. Aware
that the enemy was not far distant, he threw out in advance a body of
scouts under Amyntas, consisting of four squadrons of light cavalry
and one of the heavy Macedonian (Companion) cavalry. From Hermôtus
(the fourth day from Arisbê) he marched direct towards the Granikus,
in careful order, with his main phalanx in double files, his cavalry
on each wing, and the baggage in the rear. On approaching the river,
he made his dispositions for immediate attack, though Parmenio
advised waiting until the next morning. Knowing well, like Memnon on
the other side, that the chances of a pitched battle were all against
the Persians, he resolved to leave them no opportunity of decamping
during the night.</p>

<p>In Alexander’s array, the phalanx or heavy infantry formed the
central body. The six Taxeis or divisions, of which it consisted,
were commanded (reckoning from right to left) by Perdikkas, Kœnus,
Amyntas son of Andromenes, Philippus, Meleager, and Kraterus.<a
id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Immediately on the right of the phalanx, were the hypaspistæ,
or light infantry, under Nikanor son of Parmenio—then the light
horse or lancers, the Pæonians, and the Apolloniate squadron of
Companion-cavalry commanded by the Ilarch Sokrates, all under
Amyntas son of Arrhibæus—lastly the full body of Companion-cavalry,
the bowmen, and the Agrianian darters, all under Philôtas
(son of Parmenio), whose division formed the extreme right.<a
id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
The left flank of the phalanx<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p.
82]</span> was in like manner protected by three distinct divisions
of cavalry or lighter troops—first, by the Thracians, under
Agathon—next, by the cavalry of the allies, under Philippus, son
of Menelaus—lastly, by the Thessalian cavalry, under Kallas,
whose division formed the extreme left. Alexander himself took
the command of the right, giving that of the left to Parmenio; by
right and left are meant the two halves of the army, each of them
including three Taxeis or divisions of the phalanx with the cavalry
on its flank—for there was no recognized centre under a distinct
command. On the other side of the Granikus, the Persian cavalry
lined the bank. The Medes and Baktrians were on their right, under
Rheomithres—the Paphlagonians and Hyrkanians in the centre, under
Arsites and Spithridates—on the left were Memnon and Arsamenes,
with their divisions.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189"
class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The Persian infantry, both Asiatic and
Grecian, were kept back in reserve; the cavalry alone being relied
upon to dispute the passage of the river.</p>

<p>In this array, both parties remained for some time, watching each
other in anxious silence.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190"
class="fnanchor">[190]</a> There being no firing or smoke, as with
modern armies, all the details on each side were clearly visible
to the other; so that the Persians easily recognized Alexander
himself on the Macedonian right from the splendor of his armor and
military costume, as well as from the respectful demeanor of those
around him. Their principal leaders accordingly thronged to their
own left, which they reinforced with the main strength of their
cavalry, in order to oppose him personally. Presently he addressed
a few words of encouragement to the troops, and gave the order for
advance. He directed the first attack to be made by the squadron of
Companion-cavalry whose turn it was on that day to take the lead—(the
squadron of Apollonia, of which Sokrates was captain—commanded on
this day by Ptolemæus son of Philippus) supported by the light horse
or Lancers, the Pæonian darters (infantry), and one division of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> regularly armed infantry,
seemingly hypaspistæ.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191"
class="fnanchor">[191]</a> He then himself entered the river, at
the head of the right half of the army, cavalry and infantry, which
advanced under sound of trumpets and with the usual war-shouts.
As the occasional depths of water prevented a straightforward
march with one uniform line, the Macedonians slanted their course
suitably to the fordable spaces; keeping their front extended so as
to approach the opposite bank as much as possible in line, and not
in separate columns with flanks exposed to the Persian cavalry.<a
id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Not
merely the right under Alexander, but also the left under Parmenio,
advanced and crossed in the same movement and under the like
precautions.</p>

<p>The foremost detachment under Ptolemy and Amyntas, on reaching the
opposite bank, encountered a strenuous resistance, concentrated as it
was here upon one point. They found Memnon and his sons with the best
of the Persian cavalry immediately in their front; some on the summit
of the bank, from whence they hurled down their javelins—others
down at the water’s-edge, so as to come to closer quarters. The
Macedonians tried every effort to make good their landing, and push
their way by main force through the Persian horse, but in vain.
Having both lower ground and insecure footing, they could make no
impression, but were thrust back with some loss, and retired upon the
main body which Alexander was now bringing across. On his approaching
the shore, the same struggle was renewed around his person with
increased fervor on both sides. He was himself<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span> among the foremost, and all near him were
animated by his example. The horsemen on both sides became jammed
together, and the contest was one of physical force and pressure by
man and horse; but the Macedonians had a great advantage in being
accustomed to the use of the strong close-fighting pike, while the
Persian weapon was the missile javelin. At length the resistance
was surmounted, and Alexander with those around him, gradually
thrusting back the defenders, made good their way up the high bank
to the level ground. At other points the resistance was not equally
vigorous. The left and centre of the Macedonians, crossing at the
same time on all practicable spaces along the whole line, overpowered
the Persians stationed on the slope, and got up to the level ground
with comparative facility.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193"
class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Indeed no cavalry could possibly stand
on the bank to offer opposition to the phalanx with its array of
long pikes, wherever this could reach the ascent in any continuous
front. The easy crossing of the Macedonians at other points helped to
constrain those Persians, who were contending with Alexander himself
on the slope, to recede to the level ground above.</p>

<p>Here again, as at the water’s edge, Alexander was foremost in
personal conflict. His pike having been broken, he turned to a
soldier near him—Aretis, one of the horseguards who generally aided
him in mounting his horse—and asked for another. But this man,
having broken his pike also, showed the fragment to Alexander,
requesting him to ask some one else; upon which the Corinthian
Demaratus, one of the Companion-cavalry close at hand, gave him
his weapon instead. Thus armed anew, Alexander spurred his horse
forward against Mithridates (son-in-law<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span> of Darius), who was bringing up a column
of cavalry to attack him, but was himself considerably in advance
of it. Alexander thrust his pike into the face of Mithridates, and
laid him prostrate on the ground: he then turned to another of the
Persian leaders, Rhœsakes, who struck him a blow on the head with his
scymetar, knocked off a portion of his helmet, but did not penetrate
beyond. Alexander avenged this blow by thrusting Rhœsakes through
the body with his pike.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194"
class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Meanwhile a third Persian leader,
Spithridates, was actually close behind Alexander, with hand and
scymetar uplifted to cut him down. At this critical moment, Kleitus
son of Dropides—one of the ancient officers of Philip, high in
the Macedonian service—struck with full force at the uplifted arm
of Spithridates and severed it from the body, thus preserving
Alexander’s life. Other leading Persians, kinsmen of Spithridates,
rushed desperately on Alexander, who received many blows on his
armor, and was in much danger. But the efforts of his companions
near were redoubled, both to defend his person and to second his
adventurous daring. It was on that point that the Persian cavalry
was first broken. On the left of the Macedonian line, the Thessalian
cavalry also fought with vigor and success;<a id="FNanchor_195"
href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and the light-armed
foot, intermingled with Alexander’s cavalry generally, did great
damage to the enemy. The rout of the Persian cavalry, once begun,
speedily became general. They fled in all directions, pursued by the
Macedonians.</p>

<p>But Alexander and his officers soon checked this ardor of pursuit,
calling back their cavalry to complete his victory. The Persian
infantry, Asiatics as well as Greeks, had remained without movement
or orders, looking on the cavalry battle which had just disastrously
terminated. To them Alexander immediately turned his attention.<a
id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> He
brought up his phalanx and hypaspistæ to attack them in front, while
his cavalry assailed on all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p.
86]</span> sides their unprotected flanks and rear; he himself
charged with the cavalry, and had a horse killed under him. His
infantry alone was more numerous than they, so that against such
odds the result could hardly be doubtful. The greater part of these
mercenaries, after a valiant resistance, were cut to pieces on the
field. We are told that none escaped, except 2000 made prisoners, and
some who remained concealed in the field among the dead bodies.<a
id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>In this complete and signal defeat, the loss of the Persian
cavalry was not very serious in mere number—for only 1000 of them
were slain. But the slaughter of the leading Persians, who had
exposed themselves with extreme bravery in the personal conflict
against Alexander, was terrible. There were slain not only
Mithridates, Rhœsakes, and Spithridates, whose names have been
already mentioned,—but also Pharnakes, brother-in-law of Darius,
Mithrobarzanes satrap of Kappadokia, Atizyes, Niphates, Petines,
and others; all Persians of rank and consequence. Arsites, the
satrap of Phrygia, whose rashness had mainly caused the rejection of
Memnon’s advice, escaped from the field, but died shortly afterwards
by his own hand, from anguish and humiliation.<a id="FNanchor_198"
href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The Persian or
Perso-Grecian infantry, though probably more of them individually
escaped than is implied in Arrian’s account, was as a body
irretrievably ruined. No force was either left in the field, or could
be afterwards reassembled in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The loss on the side of Alexander is said to have been very
small. Twenty-five of the Companion-cavalry, belonging to the
division under Ptolemy and Amyntas, were slain in the first
unsuccessful attempt to pass the river. Of the other cavalry, sixty
in all were slain; of the infantry, thirty. This is given to us
as the entire loss on the side of Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_199"
href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> It is only the
number of killed; that of the wounded is not stated; but assuming
it to be ten times the number of killed, the total of both together
will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span> be 1265.<a
id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
If this be correct, the resistance of the Persian cavalry, except
near that point where Alexander himself and the Persian chiefs came
into conflict, cannot have been either serious or long protracted.
But when we add farther the contest with the infantry, the smallness
of the total assigned for Macedonian killed and wounded will appear
still more surprising. The total of the Persian infantry is stated
at nearly 20,000, most part of them Greek mercenaries. Of these only
2000 were made prisoners; nearly all the rest (according to Arrian)
were slain. Now the Greek mercenaries were well armed, and not likely
to let themselves be slain with impunity; moreover Plutarch expressly
affirms that they resisted with desperate valor, and that most of
the Macedonian loss was incurred in the conflict against them. It
is not easy therefore to comprehend how the total number of slain
can be brought within the statement of Arrian.<a id="FNanchor_201"
href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>After the victory, Alexander manifested the greatest solicitude
for his wounded soldiers, whom he visited and consoled in person.
Of the twenty-five Companions slain, he caused brazen statues, by
Lysippus, to be erected at Dium in Macedonia, where they were still
standing in the time of Arrian. To the surviving relatives of all
the slain he also granted immunity from taxation and from personal
service. The dead bodies were honorably buried, those of the enemy
as well as of his own soldiers. The two thousand Greeks in the
Persian service who had become his prisoners, were put in chains,
and transported to Macedonia, there to work as slaves; to which
treatment Alexander condemned them on the ground that they had taken
arms on behalf of the foreigner against Greece, in contravention of
the general vote passed by the synod at Corinth. At the same time,
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span> sent to Athens
three hundred panoplies selected from the spoil, to be dedicated
to Athênê in the acropolis with this inscription—“Alexander son of
Philip, and the Greeks, except the Lacedæmonians (<i>present these
offerings</i>), out of the spoils of the foreigners inhabiting Asia.”<a
id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
Though the vote to which Alexander appealed represented no existing
Grecian aspiration, and granted only a sanction which could not
be safely refused, yet he found satisfaction in clothing his own
self-aggrandizing impulse under the name of a supposed Pan-hellenic
purpose: which was at the same time useful, as strengthening his
hold upon the Greeks, who were the only persons competent, either
as officers or soldiers, to uphold the Persian empire against him.
His conquests were the extinction of genuine Hellenism, though
they diffused an exterior varnish of it, and especially the Greek
language, over much of the Oriental world. True Grecian interests lay
more on the side of Darius than of Alexander.</p>

<p>The battle of the Granikus, brought on by Arsites and the other
satraps contrary to the advice of Memnon, was moreover so unskilfully
fought by them, that the gallantry of their infantry, the most
formidable corps of Greeks that had ever been in the Persian service,
was rendered of little use. The battle, properly speaking, was fought
only by the Persian cavalry;<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203"
class="fnanchor">[203]</a> the infantry was left to be surrounded and
destroyed afterwards.</p>

<p>No victory could be more decisive or terror-striking than that
of Alexander. There remained no force in the field to oppose him.
The impression made by so great a public catastrophe was enhanced
by two accompanying circumstances; first, by the number of Persian
grandees who perished, realizing almost the wailings of Atossa,
Xerxes, and the Chorus, in the Persæ of Æschylus,<a id="FNanchor_204"
href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> after the battle of
Salamis—next, by the chivalrous and successful prowess of Alexander
himself, who, emulating the Homeric Achilles, not only rushed
foremost into the <i>mélée</i>, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p.
89]</span> killed two of these grandees with his own hand. Such
exploits, impressive even when we read of them now, must at the
moment when they occurred have acted most powerfully upon the
imagination of contemporaries.</p>

<p>Several of the neighboring Mysian mountaineers, though mutinous
subjects towards Persia, came down to make submission to him, and
were permitted to occupy their lands under the same tribute as they
had paid before. The inhabitants of the neighboring Grecian city
of Zeleia, whose troops had served with the Persians, surrendered
and obtained their pardon; Alexander admitting the plea that
they had served only under constraint. He then sent Parmenio to
attack Daskylium, the stronghold and chief residence of the satrap
of Phrygia. Even this place was evacuated by the garrison and
surrendered, doubtless with a considerable treasure therein. The
whole satrapy of Phrygia thus fell into Alexander’s power, and was
appointed to be administered by Kallas for his behalf, levying the
same amount of tribute as had been paid before.<a id="FNanchor_205"
href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> He himself then
marched, with his main force, in a southerly direction towards
Sardis—the chief town of Lydia, and the main station of the Persians
in Asia Minor. The citadel of Sardis—situated on a lofty and steep
rock projecting from Mount Tmolus, fortified by a triple wall with an
adequate garrison—was accounted impregnable, and at any rate could
hardly have been taken by anything less than a long blockade,<a
id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
which would have allowed time for the arrival of the fleet and the
operations of Memnon. Yet such was the terror which now accompanied
the Macedonian conqueror, that when he arrived within eight miles
of Sardis, he met not only a deputation of the chief citizens, but
also the Persian governor of the citadel, Mithrines. The town,
citadel, garrison, and treasure Were delivered up to him without a
blow. Fortunately for Alexander, there were not in Asia any Persian
governors of courage and fidelity such as had been displayed by
Maskames<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> and
Boges after the repulse of Xerxes from Greece.<a id="FNanchor_207"
href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Alexander treated
Mithrines with courtesy and honor, granted freedom to the Sardians
and to the other Lydians generally, with the use of their own Lydian
laws. The betrayal of Sardis by Mithrines was a signal good fortune
to Alexander. On going up to the citadel, he contemplated with
astonishment its prodigious strength; congratulating himself on so
easy an acquisition, and giving directions to build there a temple
of Olympian Zeus, on the spot where the old palace of the kings of
Lydia had been situated. He named Pausanias governor of the citadel,
with a garrison of Peloponnesians from Argos; Asander, satrap of
the country; and Nikias, collector of tribute.<a id="FNanchor_208"
href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> The freedom granted
to the Lydians, whatever it may have amounted to, did not exonerate
them from paying the usual tribute.</p>

<p>From Sardis, he ordered Kallas, the new satrap of Hellespontine
Phrygia—and Alexander son of Aëropus, who had been promoted in place
of Kallas to the command of the Thessalian cavalry—to attack Atarneus
and the district belonging to Memnon, on the Asiatic coast opposite
Lesbos. Meanwhile he himself directed his march to Ephesus, which he
reached on the fourth day. Both at Ephesus and at Miletus—the two
principal strongholds of the Persians on the coast, as Sardis was
in the interior—the sudden catastrophe at the Granikus had struck
unspeakable terror. Hegesistratus, governor of the Persian garrison
(Greek mercenaries) at Miletus, sent letters to Alexander offering to
surrender the town on his approach; while the garrison at Ephesus,
with the Macedonian exile Amyntas, got on board two triremes in
the harbor, and fled. It appears that there had been recently a
political revolution in the town, conducted by Syrphax and other
leaders, who had established an oligarchical government. These men,
banishing their political opponents, had committed depredations on
the temple of Artemis, overthrown the statue of Philip of Macedon
dedicated therein, and destroyed the sepulchre of Heropythus the
liberator in the agora.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209"
class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Some of the party, though abandoned by
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span> garrison,
were still trying to invoke aid from Memnon, who however was yet at a
distance. Alexander entered the town without resistance, restored the
exiles, established a democratical constitution, and directed that
the tribute heretofore paid to the Persians should now be paid to the
Ephesian Artemis. Syrphax and his family sought refuge in the temple,
from whence they were dragged by the people and stoned to death. More
of the same party would have been despatched, had not the popular
vengeance been restrained by Alexander; who displayed an honorable
and prudent moderation.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210"
class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Thus master of Ephesus, Alexander found himself in communication
with his fleet, under the command of Nikanor; and received
propositions of surrender from the two neighboring inland cities,
Magnesia and Tralleis. To occupy these cities, he despatched
Parmenio with 5000 foot (half of them Macedonians) and 200 of the
Companion-cavalry; while he at the same time sent Antimachus with
an equal force in a northerly direction, to liberate the various
cities of Æolic and Ionic Greeks. This officer was instructed to
put down in each of them the ruling oligarchy, which acted with
a mercenary garrison as an instrument of Persian supremacy—to
place the government in the hands of the citizens—and to abolish
all payment of tribute. He himself—after taking part in a solemn
festival and procession to the temple of Ephesian Artemis, with his
whole army in battle array—marched southward towards Miletus; his
fleet under Nikanor proceeding thither by sea.<a id="FNanchor_211"
href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> He expected
probably to enter Miletus with as little resistance as Ephesus.
But his hopes were disappointed: Hegesistratus, commander of
the garrison in that town, though under the immediate terror of
the defeat at the Granikus he had written to offer submission,
had now altered his tone, and determined to hold out. The
formidable Persian fleet,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212"
class="fnanchor">[212]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p.
92]</span> four hundred sail of Phenician and Cyprian ships of war
with well-trained seamen, was approaching.</p>

<p>This naval force, which a few weeks earlier would have prevented
Alexander from crossing into Asia, now afforded the only hope of
arresting the rapidity and ease of his conquests. What steps had been
taken by the Persian officers since the defeat at the Granikus, we
do not hear. Many of them had fled, along with Memnon, to Miletus;<a
id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
and they were probably disposed, under the present desperate
circumstances, to accept the command of Memnon as their only hope
of safety, though they had despised his counsel on the day of the
battle. Whether the towns in Memnon’s principality of Atarneus had
attempted any resistance against the Macedonians, we do not know.
His interests however were so closely identified with those of
Persia, that he had sent up his wife and children as hostages, to
induce Darius to entrust him with the supreme conduct of the war.
Orders to this effect were presently sent down by that prince;<a
id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> but
at the first arrival of the fleet, it seems not to have been under
the command of Memnon, who was however probably on board.</p>

<p>It came too late to aid in the defence of Miletus. Three days
before its arrival, Nikanor the Macedonian admiral, with his fleet of
one hundred and sixty ships, had occupied the island of Ladê, which
commanded the harbor of that city. Alexander found the outer portion
of Miletus evacuated, and took it without resistance. He was making
preparations to besiege the inner city, and had already transported
4000 troops across to the island of Ladê, when the powerful Persian
fleet came in sight, but found itself excluded from Miletus, and
obliged to take moorings under the neighboring promontory of Mykalê.
Unwilling to abandon without a battle the command of the sea,
Parmenio advised Alexander to fight this fleet, offering himself to
share the hazard aboard. But Alexander disapproved the proposition,
affirming that his fleet was inferior not less in skill than in
numbers; that the high training of the Macedonians would tell for
nothing on shipboard; and that a naval defeat would be the signal
for insurrection in Greece. Besides debating such pruden<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span>tial reasons, Alexander
and Parmenio also differed about the religious promise of the
case. On the sea-shore, near the stern of the Macedonian ships,
Parmenio had seen an eagle, which filled him with confidence that
the ships would prove victorious. But Alexander contended that this
interpretation was incorrect. Though the eagle doubtless promised
to him victory, yet it had been seen on land—and therefore his
victories would be on land: hence the result signified was, that he
would overcome the Persian fleet, by means of land-operations.<a
id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
This part of the debate, between two practical military men of
ability, is not the least interesting of the whole; illustrating
as it does, not only the religious susceptibilities of the age,
but also the pliancy of the interpretative process, lending itself
equally well to inferences totally opposite. The difference between
a sagacious and a dull-witted prophet, accommodating ambiguous omens
to useful or mischievous conclusions, was one of very material
importance in the ancient world.</p>

<p>Alexander now prepared vigorously to assault Miletus, repudiating
with disdain an offer brought to him by a Milesian citizen named
Glaukippus—that the city should be neutral and open to him as well as
to the Persians. His fleet under Nikanor occupied the harbor, blocked
up its narrow mouth against the Persians, and made threatening
demonstrations from the water’s edge; while he himself brought up
his battering-engines against the walls, shook or overthrew them
in several places, and then stormed the city. The Milesians, with
the Grecian mercenary garrison, made a brave defence, but were
overpowered by the impetuosity of the assault. A large number of
them were slain, and there was no way of escape except by jumping
into little boats, or swimming off upon the hollow of the shield.
Even of these fugitives, most part were killed by the seamen of the
Macedonian triremes; but a division of 300 Grecian mercenaries got on
to an isolated rock near the mouth of the harbor, and there prepared
to sell their lives dearly. Alexander, as soon as his soldiers were
thoroughly masters of the city, went himself on shipboard to attack
the mercenaries on the rock, taking with him ladders in order to
effect a landing upon it. But when he saw that they were resolved
on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span> desperate
defence, he preferred admitting them to terms of capitulation,
and received them into his own service.<a id="FNanchor_216"
href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> To the surviving
Milesian citizens he granted the condition of a free city, while he
caused all the remaining prisoners to be sold as slaves.</p>

<p>The powerful Persian fleet, from the neighboring promontory of
Mykalê, was compelled to witness, without being able to prevent, the
capture of Miletus, and was presently withdrawn to Halikarnassus.
At the same time Alexander came to the resolution of disbanding his
own fleet; which, while costing more than he could then afford, was
nevertheless unfit to cope with the enemy in open sea. He calculated
that by concentrating all his efforts on land-operations, especially
against the cities on the coast, he should exclude the Persian fleet
from all effective hold on Asia Minor, and ensure that country to
himself. He therefore paid off all the ships, retaining only a
moderate squadron for the purposes of transport.<a id="FNanchor_217"
href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Before this time, probably, the whole Asiatic coast northward of
Miletus—including the Ionic and Æolic cities and the principality of
Memnon—had either accepted willingly the dominion of Alexander, or
had been reduced by his detachments. Accordingly he now directed his
march southward from Miletus, towards Karia, and especially towards
Halikarnassus, the principal city of that territory. On entering
Karia, he was met by Ada, a member of the Karian princely family,
who tendered to him her town of Alinda and her other possessions,
adopting him as her son, and entreating his protection. Not many
years earlier, under Mausôlus and Artemisia, the powerful princes
of this family had been formidable to all the Grecian islands. It
was the custom of Karia that brothers and sisters of the reigning
family intermarried with each other: Mausôlus and his wife Artemisia
were succeeded by Idrieus and his wife Ada, all four being brothers
and sisters, sons and daughters of Hekatomnus. On the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span> death of Idrieus, his
widow Ada, was expelled from Halikarnassus and other parts of Karia
by her surviving brother Pixodarus; though she still preserved some
strong towns, which proved a welcome addition to the conquests of
Alexander. Pixodarus, on the contrary, who had given his daughter in
marriage to a leading Persian named Orontobates, warmly espoused the
Persian cause, and made Halikarnassus a capital point of resistance
against the invader.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218"
class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>But it was not by him alone that this city was defended. The
Persian fleet had repaired thither from Miletus; Memnon, now invested
by Darius with supreme command on the Asiatic coast and the Ægean,
was there in person. There was not only Orontobates with many other
Asiatics, but also a large garrison of mercenary Greeks, commanded
by Ephialtes, a brave Athenian exile. The city, strong both by
nature and by art, with a surrounding ditch forty-five feet broad
and twenty-two feet deep,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219"
class="fnanchor">[219]</a> had been still farther strengthened
under the prolonged superintendence of Memnon;<a id="FNanchor_220"
href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> lastly, there were
two citadels, a fortified harbor, with its entrance fronting the
south, abundant magazines of arms, and good provision of defensive
engines. The siege of Halikarnassus was the most arduous enterprise
which Alexander had yet undertaken. Instead of attacking it by land
and sea at once, as at Miletus, he could make his approaches only
from the land, while the defenders were powerfully aided from seaward
by the Persian ships with their numerous crews.</p>

<p>His first efforts, directed against the gate on the north or
north-east of the city, which led towards Mylasa, were interrupted
by frequent sallies and discharges from the engines on the walls.
After a few days thus spent without much avail, he passed with a
large section of his army to the western side of the town, towards
the outlying portion of the projecting tongue of land, on which
Halikarnassus and Myndus (the latter farther westward) were situated.
While making demonstrations on this side of Halikarnassus, he at
the same time attempted a night-attack on Myn<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>dus, but was obliged to retire after some
hours of fruitless effort. He then confined himself to the siege
of Halikarnassus. His soldiers, protected from missiles by movable
penthouses (called Tortoises), gradually filled up the wide and deep
ditch round the town, so as to open a level road for his engines
(rolling towers of wood) to come up close to the walls. The engines
being brought up close, the work of demolition was successfully
prosecuted; notwithstanding vigorous sallies from the garrison,
repulsed; though not without loss and difficulty, by the Macedonians.
Presently the shock of the battering-engines had overthrown two
towers of the city-wall, together with two intermediate breadths of
wall; and a third tower was beginning to totter. The besieged were
employed in erecting an inner wall of brick to cover the open space,
and a wooden tower of the great height of 150 feet for the purpose
of casting projectiles.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221"
class="fnanchor">[221]</a> It appears that Alexander waited for the
full demolition of the third tower, before he thought the breach
wide enough to be stormed; but an assault was prematurely brought
on by two adventurous soldiers from the division of Perdikkas.<a
id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
These men, elate with wine, rushed up single-handed to attack the
Mylasean gate, and slew the foremost of the defenders who came out to
oppose them, until at length, reinforcements arriving successively
on both sides, a general combat took place at a short distance from
the wall. In the end, the Macedonians were victorious, and drove
the besieged back into the city. Such was the confusion, that the
city might then have been assaulted and taken, had measures been
prepared for it beforehand. The third tower was speedily overthrown;
nevertheless, before this could be accomplished, the besieged had
already completed their half-moon within, against which accordingly,
on the next day, Alexander pushed forward his engines. In this
advanced position, however, being as it were within the circle
of the city-wall, the Macedonians were exposed to discharges not
only from engines in their front, but also from the towers yet
standing on each side of them. Moreover, at night, a fresh sally
was made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span> with
so much impetuosity, that some of the covering wicker-work of the
engines, and even the main wood-work of one of them, was burnt. It
was not without difficulty that Philôtas and Hellanikus, the officers
on guard, preserved the remainder; nor were the besieged finally
driven in, until Alexander himself appeared with reinforcements.<a
id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Though his troops had been victors in these successive combats,
yet he could not carry off his dead, who lay close to the walls,
without soliciting a truce for burial. Such request usually counted
as a confession of defeat: nevertheless Alexander solicited the
truce, which was granted by Memnon, in spite of the contrary
opinion of Ephialtes.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224"
class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>After a few days of interval, for burying his dead and repairing
the engines, Alexander recommenced attack upon the half-moon,
under his own personal superintendence. Among the leaders within,
a conviction gained ground that the place could not long hold out.
Ephialtes especially, resolved not to survive the capture, and
seeing that the only chance of preservation consisted in destroying
the besieging engines, obtained permission from Memnon to put
himself at the head of a last desperate sally.<a id="FNanchor_225"
href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> He took immediately
near him 2000 chosen troops, half to encounter the enemy, half
with torches to burn the engines. At daybreak, all the gates
being suddenly and simultaneously thrown<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> open, sallying parties rushed out from
each against the besiegers; the engines from within supporting them
by multiplied discharges of missiles. Ephialtes with his division,
marching straight against the Macedonians on guard at the main
point of attack, assailed them impetuously, while his torch-bearers
tried to set the engines on fire. Himself distinguished no less for
personal strength than for valor, he occupied the front rank, and
was so well seconded by the courage and good array of his soldiers
charging in deep column, that for a time he gained advantage. Some of
the engines were successfully fired, and the advanced guard of the
Macedonian troops, consisting of young troops, gave way and fled.
They were rallied partly by the efforts of Alexander, but still
more by the older Macedonian soldiers, companions in all Philip’s
campaigns; who, standing exempt from night-watches, were encamped
more in the rear. These veterans, among whom one Atharrias was the
most conspicuous, upbraiding the cowardice of their comrades,<a
id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
cast themselves into their accustomed phalanx-array, and thus both
withstood and repulsed the charge of the victorious enemy. Ephialtes,
foremost among the combatants, was slain, the rest were driven back
to the city, and the burning engines were saved with some damage.
During this same time, an obstinate conflict had also taken place at
the gate called Tripylon, where the besieged had made another sally,
over a narrow bridge thrown across the ditch. Here the Macedonians
were under the command of Ptolemy (not the son of Lagus), one of the
king’s body-guards. He, with two or three other conspicuous officers,
perished in the severe struggle which ensued, but the sallying party
were at length repulsed and driven into the city.<a id="FNanchor_227"
href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The loss of the
besieged was severe, in trying to get again within the walls, under
vigorous pursuit from the Macedonians.</p>

<p>By this last unsuccessful effort, the defensive force of
Halikar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span>nassus
was broken. Memnon and Orontobates, satisfied that no longer
defence of the town was practicable, took advantage of the night
to set fire to their wooden projectile engines and towers, as
well as to their magazines of arms, with the houses near the
exterior wall, while they carried away the troops, stores, and
inhabitants, partly to the citadel called Salmakis—partly to the
neighboring islet called Arkonnesus—partly to the island of Kos.<a
id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Though thus evacuating the town, however, they still kept good
garrisons well-provisioned in the two citadels belonging to it. The
conflagration, stimulated by a strong wind, spread widely. It was
only extinguished by the orders of Alexander, when he entered the
town, and put to death all those whom he found with firebrands. He
directed that the Halikarnassians found in the houses should be
spared, but that the city itself should be demolished. He assigned
the whole of Karia to Ada, as a principality, doubtless under
condition of tribute. As the citadels still occupied by the enemy
were strong enough to require a long siege, he did not think it
necessary to remain in person for the purpose of reducing them;
but surrounding them with a wall of blockade, he left Ptolemy and
3000 men to guard it.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229"
class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Having concluded the siege of Halikarnassus, Alexander sent back
his artillery to Tralles, ordering Parmenio, with a large portion
of the cavalry, the allied infantry, and the baggage waggons, to
Sardis.</p>

<p>The ensuing winter months he employed in the conquest of Lykia,
Pamphylia, and Pisidia. All this southern coast of Asia Minor is
mountainous; the range of Mount Taurus descending nearly to the sea,
so as to leave little or no intervening breadth of plain. In spite
of great strength of situation, such was the terror of Alexander’s
arms, that all the Lykian towns—Hyparna, Telmissus, Pinara, Xanthus,
Patara, and thirty others—submitted to him without a blow.<a
id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
One alone among them, called Marmareis, resisted to desperation.<a
id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
On reaching the territory called Milyas, the Phrygian frontier of
Lykia, Alexander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span>
received the surrender of the Greek maritime city, Phasêlis. He
assisted the Phaselites in destroying a mountain fort erected and
garrisoned against them by the neighboring Pisidian mountaineers, and
paid a public compliment to the sepulchre of their deceased townsman,
the rhetorician Theodektes.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232"
class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>After this brief halt at Phasêlis, Alexander directed his course
to Pergê in Pamphylia. The ordinary mountain road, by which he sent
most of his army, was so difficult as to require some leveling by
Thracian light troops sent in advance for the purpose. But the
king himself, with a select detachment, took a road more difficult
still, under the mountains by the brink of the sea, called Klimax.
When the wind blew from the south, this road was covered by such
a depth of water as to be impracticable; for some time before he
reached the spot, the wind had blown strong from the south—but
as he came near, the special providence of the gods (so he and
his friends conceived it) brought on a change to the north, so
that the sea receded and left an available passage, though his
soldiers had the water up to their waists.<a id="FNanchor_233"
href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> From Pergê he
marched on to Sidê, receiving on his way envoys from Aspendus, who
offered to surrender their city, but deprecated the entrance of a
garrison; which they were allowed to buy off promising fifty talents
in money, together with the horses which they were bringing up as
tribute for the Persian king. Having left a garrison at Sidê, he
advanced onward to a strong place called Syllium, defended by brave
natives with a body of mercenaries to aid them. These men held
out, and even repulsed a first assault; which Alexander could not
stay to repeat, being apprised that the Aspendians had refused to
execute the conditions imposed, and had put their city in a state
of defence. Returning rapidly, he constrained them to submission,
and then marched back to Pergê; from whence he directed his course
towards the greater Phrygia,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234"
class="fnanchor">[234]</a> through the difficult mountains, and
almost indomitable population, of Pisidia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span>After
remaining in the Pisidian mountains long enough to reduce several
towns or strong posts, Alexander proceeded northward into Phrygia,
passing by the salt lake called Askanius to the steep and
impregnable fortress of Kelænæ, garrisoned by 1000 Karians, and
100 mercenary Greeks. These men, having no hope of relief from
the Persians, offered to deliver up the fortress, unless such
relief should arrive before the sixtieth day.<a id="FNanchor_235"
href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Alexander accepted
the propositions, remained ten days at Kelænæ, and left there
Antigonus (afterwards the most powerful among his successors) as
satrap of Phrygia, with 1500 men. He then marched northward to
Gordium on the river Sangarius, where Parmenio was directed to meet
him, and where his winter-campaign was concluded.<a id="FNanchor_236"

<p class="large center g1 mt2"><big>APPENDIX.</big></p>
<p class="center">ON THE LENGTH OF THE MACEDONIAN SARISSA OR PIKE.</p>
</div>

<div class="appendix">

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">The</span> statements here given
about the length of the sarissa carried by the phalangite, are taken
from Polybius, whose description is on all points both clear and
consistent with itself. “The sarissa (he says) is sixteen cubits
long, according to the original theory; and fourteen cubits as
adapted to actual practice”—τὸ δὲ τῶν σαρισσῶν μέγεθός ἐστι, κατὰ μὲν
τὴν ἐξ ἀρχῆς ὑπόθεσιν, ἑκκαίδεκα πηχῶν, κατὰ δὲ τὴν ἁρμογὴν τὴν πρὸς
τὴν ἀλήθειαν, δεκατεσσάρων. Τούτων δὲ τοὺς τέσσαρας ἀφαιρεῖ τὸ μεταξὺ
ταῖν χεροῖν διάστημα, καὶ τὸ κατόπιν σήκωμα τῆς προβολῆς (xviii.
12).</p>

<p>The difference here indicated by Polybius between the length in
theory, and that in practice, may probably be understood to mean,
that the phalangites, when in exercise, used pikes of the greater
length; when on service, of the smaller: just as the Roman soldiers
were trained in their exercises to use arms heavier than they
employed against an enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span>Of the later
tactic writers, Leo (Tact. vi. 39) and Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
repeat the double measurement of the sarissa as given by Polybius.
Arrian (Tact. c. 12) and Polyænus (ii. 29, 2) state its length at
sixteen cubits—Ælian (Tact. c. 14) gives fourteen cubits. All these
authors follow either Polybius, or some other authority concurrent
with him. None of them contradict him, though none state the case so
clearly as he does.</p>

<p>Messrs. Rüstow and Köchly (Gesch. des Griech. Kriegswesens,
p. 238), authors of the best work that I know respecting ancient
military matters, reject the authority of Polybius as it here stands.
They maintain that the passage must be corrupt, and that Polybius
must have meant to say that the sarissa was sixteen <i>feet</i> in
length—not sixteen <i>cubits</i>. I cannot subscribe to their opinion, nor
do I think that their criticism on Polybius is a just one.</p>

<p>First, they reason as if Polybius had said that the sarissa of
actual service was <i>sixteen</i> cubits long. Computing the weight
of such a weapon from the thickness required in the shaft, they
pronounce that it would be unmanageable. But Polybius gives the
actual length as only <i>fourteen</i> cubits: a very material difference.
If we accept the hypothesis of these authors—that corruption of the
text has made us read <i>cubits</i> where we ought to have read <i>feet</i>,—it
will follow that the length of the sarissa, as given by Polybius,
would be <i>fourteen feet</i>, not <i>sixteen feet</i>. Now this length is not
sufficient to justify various passages in which its prodigious length
is set forth.</p>

<p>Next, they impute to Polybius a contradiction in saying that
the Roman soldier occupied a space of three feet, equal to that
occupied by a Macedonian soldier—and yet that in the fight, he had
two Macedonian soldiers and ten pikes opposed to him (xviii. 13).
But there is here no contradiction at all: for Polybius expressly
says that the Roman, though occupying three feet when the legion was
drawn up in order, required, when fighting, an expansion of the ranks
and an increased interval to the extent of three feet behind him
and on each side of him (χάλασμα καὶ διάστασιν ἀλλήλων ἔχειν δεήσει
τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐλάχιστον τρεῖς πόδας κατ᾽ ἐπιστάτην καὶ παραστάτην) in
order to allow full play for his sword and shield. It is therefore
perfectly true that each Roman soldier, when actually marching up to
attack the phalanx, occupied as much ground as two phalangites, and
had ten pikes to deal with.</p>

<p>Farther, it is impossible to suppose that Polybius, in speaking of
<i>cubits</i>, really meant <i>feet</i>; because (cap. 12) he speaks of <i>three
feet</i> as the interval between each rank in the file, and these <i>three
feet</i> are clearly made equal to <i>two cubits</i>. His computation will
not come right, if in place of <i>cubits</i> you substitute <i>feet</i>.</p>

<p>We must therefore take the assertion of Polybius as we find it:
that the pike of the phalangite was fourteen cubits or twenty-one
feet in length. Now Polybius had every means of being well informed
on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span> such a point.
He was above thirty years of age at the time of the last war of the
Romans against the Macedonian king Perseus, in which war he himself
served. He was intimately acquainted with Scipio, the son of Paulus
Emilius, who gained the battle of Pydna. Lastly, he had paid great
attention to tactics, and had even written an express work on the
subject.</p>

<p>It might indeed be imagined, that the statement of Polybius,
though true as to his own time, was not true as to the time of
Philip and Alexander. But there is nothing to countenance such a
suspicion—which moreover is expressly disclaimed by Rüstow and
Köchly.</p>

<p>Doubtless twenty-one feet is a prodigious length, unmanageable,
except by men properly trained, and inconvenient for all evolutions.
But these are just the terms under which the pike of the phalangite
is always spoken of. So Livy, xxxi. 39, “Erant pleraque silvestria
circa, incommoda phalangi maximè Macedonum: quæ, nisi ubi <i>prælongis
hastis</i> velut vallum ante clypeos objecit (quod ut fiat, libero campo
opus est) nullius admodum usus est.” Compare also Livy, xliv. 40, 41,
where, among other intimations of the immense length of the pike, we
find, “Si carptim aggrediendo, circumagere <i>immobilem longitudine et
gravitate hastam</i> cogas, confusâ strue implicatur:” also xxxiii. 8,
9.</p>

<p>Xenophon tells us that the Ten Thousand Greeks in their retreat
had to fight their way across the territory of the Chalybes, who
carried a pike <i>fifteen cubits</i> long, together with a short sword; he
does not mention a shield, but they wore greaves and helmets (Anab.
iv. 7, 15). This is a length greater than what Polybius ascribes to
the pike of the Macedonian phalangite. The Mosynœki defended their
citadel “with pikes so long and thick that a man could hardly carry
them” (Anabas. v. 4, 25). In the Iliad, when the Trojans are pressing
hard upon the Greek ships, and seeking to set them on fire, Ajax is
described as planting himself upon the poop, and keeping off the
assailants with a thrusting-pike of twenty-two cubits or thirty-three
feet in length (ξυστὸν ναύμαχον ἐν παλάμῃσιν—δυωκαιεικοσίπηχυ, Iliad,
xv. 678). The spear of Hektor is ten cubits, or eleven cubits,
in length—intended to be hurled (Iliad vi. 319; viii. 494)—the
reading is not settled whether ἔγχος ἔχ᾽ ἑνδεκάπηχυ, or ἔγχος ἔχεν
δεκάπηχυ.</p>

<p>The Swiss infantry, and the German Landsknechte, in the sixteenth
century, were in many respects a reproduction of the Macedonian
phalanx: close ranks, deep files, long pikes, and the three or
four first ranks, composed of the strongest and bravest men in the
regiment—either officers, or picked soldiers receiving double pay.
The length and impenetrable array of their pikes enabled them to
resist the charge of the heavy cavalry or men at arms: they were
irresistible in front, unless an enemy could find means to break in
among the pikes, which was sometimes, though rarely, done. Their
great confidence was in the length of the pike—Macciavelli says of
them (Ritratti dell’ Alamagna, Opere t. iv. p. 159; and Dell’ Arte
della Guerra, p. 232-236),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p.
104]</span> “Dicono tenere tale ordine, che non é possibile entrare
tra loro, né accostarseli, quanto é la picca lunga. Sono ottime genti
in campagna, à far giornata: ma per espugnare terra non vagliono, e
poco nel difenderlo: ed universalmente, dove non possano tenere l’
ordine loro della milizia, non vagliono.”</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XCIII.<br />
    SECOND AND THIRD ASIATIC CAMPAIGNS OF ALEXANDER — BATTLE
    OF&nbsp;ISSUS — SIEGE OF&nbsp;TYRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">It</span> was about February or
March 333 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, when Alexander
reached Gordium; where he appears to have halted for some time,
giving to the troops who had been with him in Pisidia a repose
doubtless needful. While at Gordium, he performed the memorable
exploit familiarly known as the cutting of the Gordian knot. There
was preserved in the citadel an ancient waggon of rude structure,
said by the legend to have once belonged to the peasant Gordius and
his son Midas—the primitive rustic kings of Phrygia, designated as
such by the gods, and chosen by the people. The cord (composed of
fibres from the bark of the cornel tree), attaching the yoke of
this waggon to the pole, was so twisted and entangled as to form
a knot of singular complexity, which no one had ever been able to
untie. An oracle had pronounced, that to the person who should
untie it the empire of Asia was destined. When Alexander went up
to see this ancient relic, the surrounding multitude, Phrygian as
well as Macedonian, were full of expectation that the conqueror of
the Granikus and of Halikarnassus would overcome the difficulties
of the knot, and acquire the promised empire. But Alexander, on
inspecting the knot, was as much perplexed as others had been before
him, until at length, in a fit of impatience, he drew his sword
and severed the cord in two. By every one this was accepted as a
solution of the problem, thus making good his title to the empire
of Asia; a belief which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p.
105]</span> gods ratified by a storm of thunder and lightning
during the ensuing night.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237"
class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>At Gordium, Alexander was visited by envoys from Athens,
entreating the liberation of the Athenian prisoners taken at the
Granikus, who were now at work chained in the Macedonian mines.
But he refused this prayer until a more convenient season. Aware
that the Greeks were held attached to him only by their fears, and
that, if opportunity occurred, a large fraction of them would take
part with the Persians, he did not think it prudent to relax his
hold upon their conduct.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238"
class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Such opportunity seemed now not unlikely to occur. Memnon,
excluded from efficacious action on the continent since the loss of
Halikarnassus, was employed among the islands of the Ægean (during
the first half of 333 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), with
the purpose of carrying war into Greece and Macedonia. Invested
with the most ample command, he had a large Phenician fleet and a
considerable body of Grecian mercenaries, together with his nephew
Pharnabazus and the Persian Autophradates. Having acquired the
important island of Chios, through the co-operation of a part of its
inhabitants, he next landed on Lesbos, where four out of the five
cities, either from fear or preference, declared in his favor; while
Mitylênê, the greatest of the five, already occupied by a Macedonian
garrison, stood out against him. Memnon accordingly disembarked
his troops and commenced the blockade of the city both by sea and
land, surrounding it with a double palisade wall from sea to sea.
In the midst of this operation he died of sickness; but his nephew
Pharnabazus, to whom he had consigned the command provisionally,
until the pleasure of Darius could be known, prosecuted his measures
vigorously, and brought the city to a capitulation. It was stipulated
that the garrison introduced by Alexander should be dismissed; that
the column, recording alliance with him, should be demolished; that
the Mityleneans should become allies of Darius, upon the terms of
the old convention called by the name of Antalkidas; and that the
citizens in banishment should be recalled, with restitution of half
their property. But Pharnabazus, as soon as admitted, vio<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>lated the capitulation
at once. He not only extorted contributions, but introduced a
garrison under Lykomêdes, and established a returned exile named
Diogenes as despot.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"
class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Such breach of faith was ill calculated to
assist the farther extension of Persian influence in Greece.</p>

<p>Had the Persian fleet been equally active a year earlier,
Alexander’s army could never have landed in Asia. Nevertheless,
the acquisitions of Chios and Lesbos, late as they were in coming,
were highly important as promising future progress. Several of
the Cyclades islands sent to tender their adhesion to the Persian
cause; the fleet was expected in Eubœa, and the Spartans began to
count upon aid for an anti-Macedonian movement.<a id="FNanchor_240"
href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> But all these hopes
were destroyed by the unexpected decease of Memnon.</p>

<p>It was not merely the superior ability of Memnon, but also his
established reputation both with Greeks and Persians, which rendered
his death a fatal blow to the interests of Darius. The Persians had
with them other Greek officers—brave and able—probably some not
unfit to execute the full Memnonian schemes. But none of them had
gone through the same experience in the art of exercising command
among Orientals—none of them had acquired the confidence of Darius
to the same extent, so as to be invested with the real guidance of
operations, and upheld against court-calumnies. Though Alexander had
now become master of Asia Minor, yet the Persians had ample means,
if effectively used, of defending all that yet remained, and even
of seriously disturbing him at home. But with Memnon vanished the
last chance of employing these means with wisdom or energy. The full
value of his loss was better appreciated by the intelligent enemy
whom he opposed, than by the feeble master whom he served. The death
of Memnon lessening the efficiency of the Persians at sea, allowed
full leisure to reorganize the Macedonian fleet,<a id="FNanchor_241"
href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and to employ the
undivided land-force for farther inland conquest.<a id="FNanchor_242"
href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span>If Alexander
was a gainer in respect to his own operations by the death of
this eminent Rhodian, he was yet more a gainer by the change of
policy which that event induced Darius to adopt. The Persian king
resolved to renounce the defensive schemes of Memnon, and to take
the offensive against the Macedonians on land. His troops, already
summoned from the various parts of the empire, had partially arrived,
and were still coming in.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243"
class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Their numbers became greater and greater,
amounting at length to a vast and multitudinous host, the total of
which is given by some as 600,000 men; by others, as 400,000 infantry
and 100,000 cavalry. The spectacle of this showy and imposing mass,
in every variety of arms, costume, and language, filled the mind of
Darius with confidence; especially as there were among them between
20,000 and 30,000 Grecian mercenaries. The Persian courtiers,
themselves elate and sanguine, stimulated and exaggerated the same
feeling in the king himself, who became confirmed in his persuasion
that his enemies could never resist him. From Sogdiana, Baktria,
and India, the contingents had not yet had time to arrive; but most
of those between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian sea had come
in—Persians, Medes, Armenians, Derbikes, Barkanians, Hyrkanians,
Katdakes, etc.; all of whom, mustered in the plains of Mesopotamia,
are said to have been counted, like the troops of Xerxes in the plain
of Doriskus, by paling off a space capable of containing exactly
10,000 men, and passing all the soldiers through it in succession.<a
id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
Neither Darius himself, nor any of those around him, had ever before
seen so overwhelming a manifestation of the Persian imperial force.
To an Oriental eye, incapable of appreciating the real conditions
of military preponderance,—accustomed only to the gross and visible
computation of numbers and physical strength,—the king who marched
forth at the head of such an army appeared like a god on earth,
certain to trample down all before him—just as most Greeks had
con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>ceived
respecting Xerxes,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245"
class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and by stronger reason Xerxes respecting
himself, a century and a half before. Because all this turned out a
ruinous mistake, the description of the feeling, given in Curtius
and Diodorus, is often mistrusted as baseless rhetoric. Yet it is in
reality the self-suggested illusion of untaught men, as opposed to
trained and scientific judgment.</p>

<p>But though such was the persuasion of Orientals, it found no
response in the bosom of an intelligent Athenian. Among the Greeks
now near Darius, was the Athenian exile Charidemus, who having
incurred the implacable enmity of Alexander, had been forced to quit
Athens after the Macedonian capture of Thebes, and had fled together
with Ephialtes to the Persians. Darius, elate with the apparent
omnipotence of his army under review, and hearing but one voice of
devoted concurrence from the courtiers around him, asked the opinion
of Charidemus, in full expectation of receiving an affirmative
reply. So completely were the hopes of Charidemus bound up with
the success of Darius, that he would not suppress his convictions,
however unpalatable, at a moment when there was yet a possibility
that they might prove useful. He replied (with the same frankness
as Demaratus had once employed towards Xerxes), that the vast
multitude now before him were unfit to cope with the comparatively
small number of the invaders. He advised Darius to place no reliance
on Asiatics, but to employ his immense treasures in subsidizing an
increased army of Grecian mercenaries. He tendered his own hearty
services either to assist or to command. To Darius, what he said
was alike surprising and offensive; in the Persian courtiers, it
provoked intolerable wrath. Intoxicated as they all were with the
spectacle of their present muster, it seemed to them a combination of
insult with absurdity, to pronounce Asiatics worthless as compared
with Macedonians, and to teach the king that his empire could be
defended by none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>
but Greeks. They denounced Charidemus as a traitor who wished to
acquire the king’s confidence in order to betray him to Alexander.
Darius, himself stung with the reply, and still farther exasperated
by the clamors of his courtiers, seized with his own hands the girdle
of Charidemus, and consigned him to the guards for execution. “You
will discover too late (exclaimed the Athenian), the truth of what
I have said. My avenger will soon be upon you.”<a id="FNanchor_246"
href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Filled as he now was with certain anticipations of success and
glory, Darius resolved to assume in person the command of his
army, and march down to overwhelm Alexander. From this moment, his
land-army became the really important and aggressive force, with
which he himself was to act. Herein we note his distinct abandonment
of the plans of Memnon—the turning-point of his future fortune. He
abandoned them, too, at the precise moment when they might have been
most safely and completely executed. For at the time of the battle
of the Granikus, when Memnon’s counsel was originally given, the
defensive part of it was not easy to act upon; since the Persians had
no very strong or commanding position. But now, in the spring of 333
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, they had a line of defence
as good as they could possibly desire; advantages, indeed, scarcely
to be paralleled elsewhere. In the first place, there was the line
of Mount Taurus, barring the entrance of Alexander into Kilikia; a
line of defence (as will presently appear) nearly inexpugnable. Next,
even if Alexander had succeeded in forcing this line and mastering
Kilikia, there would yet remain the narrow road between Mount Amanus
and the sea, called the Amanian Gates, and the Gates of Kilikia and
Assyria—and after that, the passes over Mount Amanus itself— all
indispensable for Alexander to pass through, and capable of being
held, with proper precautions, against the strongest force of attack.
A better opportunity, for executing the defensive part of Memnon’s
scheme, could not present itself; and he himself must doubtless have
reckoned that such advantages would not be thrown away.</p>

<p>The momentous change of policy, on the part of the Persian king,
was manifested by the order which he sent to the fleet after<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span> receiving intelligence
of the death of Memnon. Confirming the appointment of Pharnabazus
(made provisionally by the dying Memnon) as admiral, he at the same
time despatched Thymôdes (son of Mentor and nephew of Memnon) to
bring away from the fleet the Grecian mercenaries who served aboard,
to be incorporated with the main Persian army.<a id="FNanchor_247"
href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Here was a clear
proof that the main stress of offensive operations was henceforward
to be transferred from the sea to the land.</p>

<p>It is the more important to note such desertion of policy, on the
part of Darius, as the critical turning-point in the Greco-Persian
drama—because Arrian and the other historians leave it out of sight,
and set before us little except the secondary points in the case.
Thus, for example, they condemn the imprudence of Darius, for coming
to fight Alexander within the narrow space near Issus, instead of
waiting for him on the spacious plains beyond Mount Amanus. Now,
unquestionably, granting that a general battle was inevitable, this
step augmented the chances in favor of the Macedonians. But it was a
step upon which no material consequences turned; for the Persian army
under Darius was hardly less unfit for a pitched battle in the open
plain; as was afterwards proved at Arbela. The real imprudence—the
neglect of the Memnonian warning—consisted in fighting the battle at
all. Mountains and defiles were the real strength of the Persians,
to be held as posts of defence against the invader. If Darius erred,
it was not so much in relinquishing the open plain of Sochi, as in
originally preferring that plain with a pitched battle, to the strong
lines of defence offered by Taurus and Amanus.</p>

<p>The narrative of Arrian, exact perhaps in what it affirms, is not
only brief and incomplete, but even omits on various occasions to put
in relief the really important and determining points.</p>

<p>While halting at Gordium, Alexander was joined by those
newly-married Macedonians whom he had sent home to winter, and who
now came back with reinforcements to the number of 3000 infantry and
300 cavalry, together with 200 Thessalian cavalry, and 150 Eleians.<a
id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
As soon as his troops had been suf<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>ficiently rested, he marched (probably
about the latter half of May) towards Paphlagonia and Kappadokia.
At Ankyra he was met by a deputation from the Paphlagonians, who
submitted themselves to his discretion, only entreating that he
would not conduct his army into their country. Accepting these
terms, he placed them under the government of Kallas, his satrap of
Hellespontine Phrygia. Advancing farther, he subdued the whole of
Kappadokia, even to a considerable extent beyond the Halys, leaving
therein Sabiktas as satrap.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249"
class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>Having established security in his rear, Alexander marched
southward towards Mount Taurus. He reached a post called the Camp
of Cyrus, at the northern foot of that mountain, near the pass
Tauri-pylæ, or Kilikian Gates, which forms the regular communication,
between Kappadokia on the north side, and Kilikia on the south,
of this great chain. The long road ascending and descending was
generally narrow, winding, and rugged, sometimes between two steep
and high banks; and it included, near its southern termination,
one spot particularly obstructed and difficult. From ancient
times, down to the present, the main road from Asia Minor into
Kilikia and Syria has run through this pass. During the Roman
empire, it must doubtless have received many improvements, so as
to render the traffic comparatively easier. Yet the description
given of it by modern travellers represents it to be as difficult
as any road ever traversed by an army.<a id="FNanchor_250"
href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Seventy years
before Alexander, it had been traversed by the younger Cyrus
with the 10,000 Greeks, in his march up to attack his brother
Artaxerxes; and Xenophon,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
class="fnanchor">[251]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p.
112]</span> who then went through it, pronounces it absolutely
impracticable for an army, if opposed by any occupying force. So
thoroughly persuaded was Cyrus himself of this fact, that he had
prepared a fleet, in case he found the pass occupied, to land troops
by sea in Kilikia in the rear of the defenders; and great indeed
was his astonishment, to discover that the habitual recklessness
of Persian management had left the defile unguarded. The narrowest
part, while hardly sufficient to contain four armed men abreast,
was shut in by precipitous rock on each side.<a id="FNanchor_252"
href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Here, if anywhere,
was the spot in which the defensive policy of Memnon might have been
made sure. To Alexander, inferior as he was by sea, the resource
employed by the younger Cyrus was not open.</p>

<p>Yet Arsames, the Persian satrap commanding at Tarsus in Kilikia,
having received seemingly from his master no instructions, or worse
than none, acted as if ignorant of the existence of his enterprising
enemy north of Mount Taurus. On the first approach of Alexander,
the few Persian soldiers occupying the pass fled without striking
a blow, being seemingly unprepared for any enemy more formidable
than mountain-robbers. Alexander thus became master of this almost
insuperable barrier, without the loss of a man.<a id="FNanchor_253"
href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> On the ensuing day,
he marched his whole army over it into Kilikia, and arriving in a
few hours at Tarsus, found the town already evacuated by Arsames.<a
id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>At Tarsus Alexander made a long halt; much longer than he
intended. Either from excessive fatigue—or from bathing while hot in
the chilly water of the river Kydnus—he was seized with a violent
fever, which presently increased to so dangerous a pitch that his
life was despaired of. Amidst the grief and alarm with which this
misfortune filled the army, none of the physicians would venture
to administer remedies, for fear of being<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> held responsible for what threatened
to be a fatal result.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255"
class="fnanchor">[255]</a> One alone among them, an Akarnanian
named Philippus, long known and trusted by Alexander, engaged to
cure him by a violent purgative draught. Alexander directed him to
prepare it; but before the time for taking it arrived, he received
a confidential letter from Parmenio, entreating him to beware of
Philippus, who had been bribed by Darius to poison him. After reading
the letter, he put it under his pillow. Presently came Philippus with
the medicine, which Alexander accepted and swallowed without remark,
at the same time giving Philippus the letter to read, and watching
the expression of his countenance. The look, words, and gestures of
the physician were such as completely to reassure him. Philippus,
indignantly repudiating the calumny, repeated his full confidence
in the medicine, and pledged himself to abide the result. At first
it operated so violently as to make Alexander seemingly worse, and
even to bring him to death’s door; but after a certain interval, its
healing effects became manifest. The fever was subdued, and Alexander
was pronounced out of danger, to the delight of the whole army.<a
id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> A
reasonable time sufficed, to restore him to his former health and
vigor.</p>

<p>It was his first operation, after recovery, to send forward
Parmenio, at the head of the Greeks, Thessalians, and Thracians,
in his army, for the purpose of clearing the forward route and
of securing the pass called the Gates of Kilikia and Syria.<a
id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
This narrow road, bounded by the range of Mount Amanus on the
east and by the sea on the west, had been once barred by a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> double cross-wall
with gates for passage, marking the original boundaries of Kilikia
and Syria. The Gates, about six days’ march beyond Tarsus,<a
id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
were found guarded, but the guard fled with little resistance. At
the same time Alexander himself, conducting the Macedonian troops
in a south-westerly direction from Tarsus, employed some time
in mastering and regulating the towns of Anchialus and Soli, as
well as the Kilikian mountaineers. Then, returning to Tarsus, and
recommencing his forward march, he advanced with the infantry and
with his chosen squadron of cavalry, first to Magarsus near the mouth
of the river Pyramus, next to Mallus; the general body of cavalry,
under Philôtus, being sent by a more direct route across the Alëian
plain. Mallus, sacred to the prophet Amphilocus as a patron-hero,
was said to be a colony from Argos; on both these grounds Alexander
was disposed to treat it with peculiar respect. He offered solemn
sacrifice to Amphilocus, exempted Mallus from tribute, and appeased
some troublesome discord among the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_259"
href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>It was at Mallus that he received his first distinct communication
respecting Darius and the main Persian army; which was said to be
encamped at Sochi in Syria, on the eastern side of Mount Amanus,
about two days’ march from the mountain pass now called Beylan.
That pass, traversing the Amanian range, forms the continuance of
the main road from Asia Minor into Syria, after having passed first
over Taurus, and next through the difficult point of ground above
specified (called the Gates of Kilikia and Syria), between Mount
Amanus and the sea. Assembling his principal officers, Alexander
communicated to them the position of Darius, now encamped in a
spacious plain with prodigious superiority of numbers, especially
of cavalry. Though the locality was thus rather favorable to the
enemy, yet the Macedonians, full of hopes and courage, called upon
Alexander to lead them forthwith against him. Accordingly Alexander,
well pleased with their alacrity, began his forward march on the
following morning. He passed through Issus, where he left some sick
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> wounded under
a moderate guard—then through the Gates of Kilikia and Syria. At
the second day’s march from those Gates, he reached the seaport of
Myriandrus, the first town of Syria or Phenicia.<a id="FNanchor_260"
href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>Here, having been detained in his camp one day by a dreadful
storm, he received intelligence which altogether changed his plans.
The Persian army had been marched away from Sochi, and was now in
Kilikia, following in his rear. It had already got possession of
Issus.</p>

<p>Darius had marched out of the interior his vast and miscellaneous
host, stated at 600,000 men. His mother, his wife, his harem, his
children, his personal attendants of every description, accompanied
him, to witness what was anticipated as a certain triumph. All the
apparatus of ostentation and luxury was provided in abundance, for
the king and for his Persian grandees. The baggage was enormous:
of gold and silver alone, we are told, that there was enough to
furnish load for 600 mules and 300 camels.<a id="FNanchor_261"
href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> A temporary bridge
being thrown over the Euphrates, five days were required to enable
the whole army to cross.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262"
class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Much of the treasure and baggage, however,
was not allowed to follow the army to the vicinity of Mount Amanus,
but was sent under a guard to Damascus in Syria.</p>

<p>At the head of such an overwhelming host, Darius was eager to
bring on at once a general battle. It was not sufficient for him
simply to keep back an enemy, whom, when once in presence, he
calculated on crushing altogether. Accordingly, he had given no
orders (as we have just seen) to defend the line of the Taurus; he
had admitted Alexander unopposed into Kilikia, and he intended to let
him enter in like manner through the remaining strong passes—first,
the Gates of Kilikia and Syria, between Mount Amanus and the
sea—next, the pass, now called Beylan, across Amanus itself. He
both expected and wished that his enemy should come into the plain
to fight, there to be trodden down by the countless horsemen of
Persia.</p>

<p>But such anticipation was not at once realized. The movements
of Alexander, hitherto so rapid and unremitting, seemed<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span> suspended. We have
already noticed the dangerous fever which threatened his life,
occasioning not only a long halt, but much uneasiness among the
Macedonian army. All was doubtless reported to the Persians,
with abundant exaggerations: and when Alexander, immediately
after recovery, instead of marching forward towards them, turned
away from them to subdue the western portion of Kilikia, this
again was construed by Darius as an evidence of hesitation and
fear. It is even asserted that Parmenio wished to await the
attack of the Persians in Kilikia, and that Alexander at first
consented to do so.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263"
class="fnanchor">[263]</a> At any rate, Darius, after a certain
interval, contracted the persuasion, and was assured by his Asiatic
councillors and courtiers, that the Macedonians, though audacious
and triumphant against frontier satraps, now hung back intimidated
by the approaching majesty and full muster of the empire, and that
they would not stand to resist his attack. Under this impression
Darius resolved upon an advance into Kilikia with all his army.
Thymôdes indeed, and other intelligent Grecian advisers—together
with the Macedonian exile Amyntas—deprecated his new resolution,
entreating him to persevere in his original purpose. They pledged
themselves that Alexander would come forth to attack him wherever
he was, and that too, speedily. They dwelt on the imprudence of
fighting in the narrow defiles of Kilikia, where his numbers, and
especially his vast cavalry, would be useless. Their advice, however,
was not only disregarded by Darius, but denounced by the Persian
councillors as traitorous.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"
class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Even some of the Greeks in the camp
shared, and transmitted in their letters to Athens, the blind
confidence of the monarch. The order was forthwith given for the
whole army to quit the plains of Syria and march across Mount<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span> Amanus into Kilikia.<a
id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> To
cross, by any pass, over such a range as that of Mount Amanus, with a
numerous army, heavy baggage, and ostentatious train (including all
the suite necessary for the regal family), must have been a work of
no inconsiderable time; and the only two passes over this mountain
were, both of them, narrow and easily defensible.<a id="FNanchor_266"
href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Darius followed the
northernmost of the two, which brought him into the rear of his
enemy.</p>

<p>Thus at the same time that the Macedonians were marching southward
to cross Mount Amanus by the southern pass, and attack Darius in
the plain—Darius was coming over into Kilikia by the northern pass
to drive them before him back into Macedonia.<a id="FNanchor_267"
href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Reaching Issus,
seemingly about two days after they had left it, he became master
of their sick and wounded left in the town. With odious brutality,
his grandees impelled him to inflict upon these poor men either
death or amputation of hands and arms.<a id="FNanchor_268"
href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> He then marched
forward—along the same road by the shore of the Gulf which had
already been followed by Alexander—and encamped on the banks of the
river Pinarus.</p>

<p>The fugitives from Issus hastened to inform Alexander, whom they
overtook at Myriandrus. So astonished was he, that he refused to
believe the news, until it had been confirmed by some officers whom
he sent northward along the coast of the Gulf in a small galley,
and to whom the vast Persian multitude on the shore was distinctly
visible. Then, assembling the chief officers, he communicated to
them the near approach of the enemy, ex<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span>patiating on the favorable auspices
under which a battle would now take place.<a id="FNanchor_269"
href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> His address was
hailed with acclamation by his hearers, who demanded only to be
led against the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270"
class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>His distance from the Persian position may have been about
eighteen miles.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271"
class="fnanchor">[271]</a> By an evening march, after supper, he
reached at midnight the narrow defile (between Mount Amanus and the
sea) called the Gates of Kilikia and Syria, through which he had
marched two days before. Again master of that important position,
he rested there the last portion of the night, and advanced forward
at daybreak northward towards Darius. At first the breadth of
practicable road was so confined, as to admit only a narrow column
of march, with the cavalry following the infantry; presently it
widened, enabling Alexander to enlarge his front by bringing up
successively the divisions of the phalanx. On approaching near to
the river Pinarus (which flowed across the pass), he adopted his
order of battle. on the extreme right he placed the hypaspists, or
light division of hoplites; next (reckoning from right to left),
five Taxeis or divisions of the phalanx, under Kœnus, Perdikkas,
Meleager, Ptolemy, and Amyntas. Of these three last or left
divisions, Kraterus had the general command; himself subject to
the orders of Parmenio, who commanded the entire left half of the
army. The breadth of plain between the mountains on the right, and
the sea on the left, is said to have been not more than fourteen
stadia, or about one English mile and a half.<a id="FNanchor_272"
href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> From fear of being
outflanked by the superior numbers of the Persians, he gave strict
orders to Parmenio to keep close to the sea. His Macedonian cavalry,
the Companions, together with the Thessalians, were placed on his
right flank; as were also the Agrianes, and the principal portion
of the light infantry. The Peloponnesian and allied cav<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span>alry, with the Thracian
and Kretan light infantry, were sent on the left flank to Parmenio.<a
id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Darius, informed that Alexander was approaching, resolved
to fight where he was encamped, behind the river Pinarus. He,
however, threw across the river a force of 30,000 cavalry, and
20,000 infantry, to ensure the undisturbed formation of his main
force behind the river.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274"
class="fnanchor">[274]</a> He composed his phalanx or main line of
battle, of 90,000 hoplites; 30,000 Greek hoplites in the centre,
and 30,000 Asiatics armed as hoplites (called Kardakes), on each
side of these Greeks. These men—not distributed into separate
divisions, but grouped in one body or multitude<a id="FNanchor_275"
href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>—filled the breadth
between the mountains and the sea. On the mountains to his left, he
placed a body of 20,000 men, intended to act against the right flank
and rear of Alexander. But for the great numerical mass of his vast
host, he could find no room to act; accordingly they remained useless
in the rear of his Greek and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p.
120]</span> Asiatic hoplites, yet not formed into any body of
reserve, or kept disposable for assisting in case of need. When his
line was thoroughly formed, he recalled to the left bank of the
Pinarus the 30,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry which he had sent
across as a protecting force. A part of this cavalry were sent to his
extreme left wing, but the mountain ground was found unsuitable for
them to act, so that they were forced to cross the right wing, where
accordingly the great mass of the Persian cavalry became assembled.
Darius himself in his chariot was in the centre of the line, behind
the Grecian hoplites. In the front of his whole line ran the river or
rivulet Pinarus; the banks of which, in many parts naturally steep,
he obstructed in some places by embankments.<a id="FNanchor_276"

<p>As soon as Alexander, by the retirement of the Persian covering
detachment, was enabled to perceive the final dispositions of Darius,
he made some alteration in his own, transferring his Thessalian
cavalry by a rear movement from his right to his left wing, and
bringing forward the lancer-cavalry or sarissophori, as well as
the light infantry, Pæonians, and archers, to the front of his
right. The Agrianians, together with some cavalry and another body
of archers, were detached from the general line to form an oblique
front against the 20,000 Persians posted on the hill to outflank
him. As these 20,000 men came near enough to threaten his flank,
Alexander directed the Agrianians to attack them, and to drive them
farther away on the hills. They manifested so little firmness, and
gave way so easily, that he felt no dread of any serious aggressive
movement from them. He therefore contented himself with holding back
in reserve against them a body of 300 heavy cavalry; while he placed
the Agrianians and the rest on the right of his main line, in order
to make his front equal to that of his enemies.<a id="FNanchor_277"
href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span>Having thus
formed his array, after giving the troops a certain halt after their
march, he advanced at a very slow pace, anxious to maintain his own
front even, and anticipating that the enemy might cross the Pinarus
to meet him. But as they did not move, he continued his advance,
preserving the uniformity of the front, until he arrived within
bowshot, when he himself, at the head of his cavalry, hypaspists,
and divisions of the phalanx on the right, accelerated his pace,
crossed the river at a quick step, and fell upon the Kardakes or
Asiatic hoplites on the Persian left. Unprepared for the suddenness
and vehemence of this attack, these Kardakes scarcely resisted a
moment, but gave way as soon as they came to close quarters, and
fled, vigorously pressed by the Macedonian right. Darius, who was in
his chariot in the centre, perceived that this untoward desertion
exposed his person from the left flank. Seized with panic, he caused
his chariot to be turned round, and fled with all speed among
the foremost fugitives.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278"
class="fnanchor">[278]</a> He kept to his chariot as long<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span> as the ground
permitted, but quitted it on reaching some rugged ravines, and
mounted on horseback to make sure of escape; in such terror, that he
cast away his bow, his shield, and his regal mantle. He does not seem
to have given a single order, nor to have made the smallest effort
to repair a first misfortune. The flight of the king was the signal
for all who observed it to flee also; so that the vast host in the
rear were quickly to be seen trampling one another down, in their
efforts to get through the difficult ground out of the reach of the
enemy. Darius was himself not merely the centre of union for all
the miscellaneous contingents composing the army, but also the sole
commander; so that after his flight there was no one left to give any
general order.</p>

<p>This great battle—we ought rather to say, that which ought to have
been a great battle—was thus lost,—through the giving way of the
Asiatic hoplites on the Persian left, and the immediate flight of
Darius,—within a few minutes after its commencement. But the centre
and right of the Persians, not yet apprised of these misfortunes,
behaved with gallantry. When Alexander made his rapid dash forward
with the right, under his own immediate command, the phalanx in his
left centre (which was under Kraterus and Parmenio) either did not
receive the same accelerating order, or found itself both retarded
and disordered by greater steepness in the banks of the Pinarus.
Here it was charged by the Grecian mercenaries, the best troops in
the Persian service. The combat which took place was obstinate, and
the Macedonian loss not inconsiderable; the general of division,
Ptolemy son of Seleukus, with 120 of the front rank men or choice
phalangites, being slain. But presently Alexander, having completed
the rout on the enemies’ left, brought back his victorious troops
from the pursuit, attacked the Grecian mercenaries in flank, and gave
decisive superiority to their enemies. These Grecian mercenaries were
beaten and forced to retire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p.
123]</span> On finding that Darius himself had fled, they got away
from the field as well as they could, yet seemingly in good order.
There is even reason to suppose that a part of them forced their
way up the mountains or through the Macedonian line, and made
their escape southward.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279"
class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile on the Persian right, towards the sea, the heavy-armed
Persian cavalry had shown much bravery. They were bold enough
to cross the Pinarus<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280"
class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and vigorously to charge the Thessalians;
with whom they maintained a close contest, until the news spread that
Darius had disappeared, and that the left of the army was routed.
They then turned their backs and fled, sustaining terrible damage
from their enemies in the retreat. Of the Kardakes on the <i>right</i>
flank of the Grecian hoplites in the Persian line, we hear nothing,
nor of the Macedonian infantry opposed to them. Perhaps these
Kardakes came little into action, since the cavalry on their part
of the field were so severely engaged. At any rate they took part
in the general flight of the Persians, as soon as Darius was known
to have left the field.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281"
class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>The rout of the Persians being completed, Alexander began a
vigorous pursuit. The destruction and slaughter of the fugitives
was prodigious. Amidst so small a breadth of practicable ground,
narrowed sometimes into a defile and broken by frequent watercourses,
their vast numbers found no room, and trod one another down.
As many perished in this way as by the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span> sword of the conquerors; insomuch
that Ptolemy (afterwards king of Egypt, the companion and
historian of Alexander) recounts that he himself in the pursuit
came to a ravine choked up with dead bodies, of which he made a
bridge to pass over it.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282"
class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The pursuit was continued as long as the
light of a November day allowed; but the battle had not begun till
a late hour. The camp of Darius was taken together with his mother,
his wife, his sister, his infant son, and two daughters. His chariot,
his shield, and his bow also fell into the power of the conquerors;
and a sum of 3000 talents in money was found, though much of the
treasure had been sent to Damascus. The total loss of the Persians
is said to have amounted to 10,000 horse and 100,000 foot; among
the slain moreover were several eminent Persian grandees,—Arsames,
Rheomithres, and Atizyes, who had commanded at the Granikus—Sabakes,
satrap of Egypt. Of the Macedonians we are told that 300 foot and
150 horse were killed. Alexander himself was slightly wounded in
the thigh by a sword.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283"
class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>The mother, wife, and family of Darius, who became captives,
were treated by Alexander’s order with the utmost consideration and
respect. When Alexander returned at night from the pursuit, he found
the regal tent reserved and prepared for him. In an inner compartment
of it he heard the tears and wailings of women. He was informed that
the mourners were the mother and wife of Darius, who had learnt that
the bow and shield of Darius had been taken, and were giving loose
to their grief under the belief that Darius himself was killed.
Alexander immediately sent Leonnatus to assure them that Darius was
still living, and to promise further that they should be allowed
to preserve the regal title and state—his war against Darius being
undertaken not from any feelings of hatred, but as a fair contest
for the empire of Asia.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284"
class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Besides this anecdote, which depends on
good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span> authority,
many others, uncertified or untrue, were recounted about his kind
behavior to these princesses; and Alexander himself, shortly after
the battle, seems to have heard fictions about it, which he thought
himself obliged to contradict in a letter. It is certain, (from
the extract now remaining of this letter) that he never saw, nor
ever entertained the idea of seeing, the captive wife of Darius,
said to be the most beautiful woman in Asia; moreover he even
declined to hear encomiums upon her beauty.<a id="FNanchor_285"
href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>How this vast host of fugitives got out of the narrow limits of
Kilikia, or how many of them quitted that country by the same pass
over Mount Amanus as that by which they had entered it—we cannot make
out. It is probable that many, and Darius himself among the number,
made their escape across the mountain by various subordinate roads
and by-paths; which, though unfit for a regular army with baggage,
would be found a welcome resource by scattered companies. Darius
managed to get together 4000 of the fugitives, with whom he hastened
to Thapsakus, and there recrossed the Euphrates. The only remnant of
force, still in a position of defence after the battle, consisted of
8000 of the Grecian mercenaries under Amyntas and Thymôdes. These
men, fighting their way out of Kilikia (seemingly towards the south,
by or near Myriandrus), marched to Tripolis on the coast of Phenicia,
where they still found the same vessels in which they had themselves
been brought from the armament of Lesbos. Seizing sufficient means
of transport, and destroying the rest to prevent pursuit, they
immediately crossed over to Cyprus, and from thence to Egypt.<a
id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
With this single exception, the enormous Persian host disappears with
the battle of Issus. We hear of no attempt to rally or reform, nor of
any fresh Persian force afoot until two years afterwards. The booty
acquired by the victors was immense, not merely in gold and silver,
but also in captives for the slave-merchant. On the morrow of the
battle, Alex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span>ander
offered a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving, with three altars erected
on the banks of the Pinarus; while he at the same time buried the
dead, consoled the wounded, and rewarded or complimented all who had
distinguished themselves.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287"
class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>No victory recorded in history was ever more complete in itself,
or more far-stretching in its consequences, than that of Issus. Not
only was the Persian force destroyed or dispersed, but the efforts
of Darius for recovery were paralyzed by the capture of his family.
Portions of the dissipated army of Issus may be traced, re-appearing
in different places for operations of detail; but we shall find no
farther resistance to Alexander and his main force, except from the
brave freemen of two fortified cities. Everywhere an overwhelming
sentiment of admiration and terror was spread abroad, towards the
force, skill, or good fortune of Alexander, by whichever name it
might be called—together with contempt for the real value of a
Persian army, in spite of so much imposing pomp and numerical show; a
contempt, not new to intelligent Greeks, but now communicated even to
vulgar minds by the recent unparalleled catastrophe. Both as general
and as soldier, indeed, the consummate excellence of Alexander stood
conspicuous, not less than the signal deficiency of Darius. The fault
in the latter, upon which most remark is usually made, was, that of
fighting the battle, not in an open plain, but in a narrow valley,
whereby his superiority of number was rendered unprofitable. But this
(as I have already observed) was only one among many mistakes, and by
no means the most serious. The result would have been the same, had
the battle been fought in the plains to the eastward of Mount Amanus.
Superior numbers are of little avail on any ground unless there be a
general who knows how to make use of them; unless they be distributed
into separate divisions ready to combine for offensive action on
many points at once, or at any rate to lend support to each other
in defence, so that a defeat of one fraction is not a defeat of the
whole. The faith of Darius in simple multitude was altogether blind
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span> childish;<a
id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
nay, that faith, though overweening beforehand, disappeared at once
when he found his enemies did not run away, but faced him boldly—as
was seen by his attitude on the banks of the Pinarus, where he stood
to be attacked instead of executing his threat of treading down the
handful opposed to him.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289"
class="fnanchor">[289]</a> But it was not merely as a general, that
Darius acted in such a manner as to render the loss of the battle
certain. Had his dispositions been ever so skilful, his personal
cowardice, in quitting the field and thinking only of his own safety,
would have sufficed to nullify their effect.<a id="FNanchor_290"
href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Though the Persian
grandees are generally conspicuous for personal courage, yet we
shall find Darius hereafter again exhibiting the like melancholy
timidity, and the like incompetence for using numbers with effect,
at the battle of Arbela, though fought in a spacious plain chosen by
himself.</p>

<p>Happy was it for Memnon, that he did not live to see the
renunciation of his schemes, and the ruin consequent upon it!
The fleet in the Ægean, which had been transferred at his death
to Pharnabazus, though weakened by the loss of those mercenaries
whom Darius had recalled to Issus, and disheartened by a serious
defeat which the Persian Orontobates had received from the
Macedonians in Karia,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291"
class="fnanchor">[291]</a> was nevertheless not inactive in trying
to organize an anti-Macedonian manifestation in Greece. While
Pharnabazus was at the island of Siphnos with his 100 triremes,
he was visited by the Lacedæmonian king Agis, who pressed him to
embark for Peloponnesus as large a force as he could spare, to
second a movement projected by the Spartans. But such aggressive
plans were at once crushed by the terror-striking news<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span> of the battle of
Issus. Apprehending a revolt in the island of Chios as the result
of this news, Pharnabazus immediately sailed thither with a large
detachment. Agis, obtaining nothing more than a subsidy of thirty
talents and a squadron of ten triremes, was obliged to renounce his
projects in Peloponnesus, and to content himself with directing some
operations in Krete, to be conducted by his brother Agesilaus; while
he himself remained among the islands, and ultimately accompanied
the Persian Autophradates to Halikarnassus.<a id="FNanchor_292"
href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> It appears, however,
that he afterwards went to conduct the operations in Krete,
and that he had considerable success in that island, bringing
several Kretan towns to join the Persians.<a id="FNanchor_293"
href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> On the whole,
however, the victory of Issus overawed all free spirit throughout
Greece, and formed a guarantee to Alexander for at least a temporary
quiescence. The philo-Macedonian synod, assembled at Corinth during
the Isthmian festival, manifested their joy by sending to him an
embassy of congratulation and a wreath of gold.<a id="FNanchor_294"
href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>With little delay after his victory, Alexander marched through
Kœle-Syria to the Phenician coast, detaching Parmenio in his way
to attack Damascus, whither Darius, before the battle, had sent
most part of his treasure with many confidential officers, Persian
women of rank, and envoys. Though the place might have held out
a considerable siege, it was surrendered without resistance
by the treason or cowardice of the governor; who made a feint
of trying to convey away the treasure, but took care that it
should fall into the hands of the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_295"
href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> There was captured
a large treasure—with a prodigious number and variety of attendants
and ministers of luxury, belonging to the court and the grandees.<a
id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
Moreover the prisoners made were so numerous,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span> that most of the great Persian families
had to deplore the loss of some relative, male or female. There were
among them the widow and daughters of king Ochus, the predecessor
of Darius—the daughter of Darius’s brother Oxathres—the wives of
Artabazus, and of Pharnabazus—the three daughters of Mentor, and
Barsinê, widow of the deceased Memnon with her child, sent up by
Memnon to serve as an hostage for his fidelity. There were also
several eminent Grecian exiles, Theban, Lacedæmonian and Athenian,
who had fled to Darius, and whom he had thought fit to send to
Damascus, instead of allowing them to use their pikes with the army
at Issus. The Theban and Athenian exiles were at once released by
Alexander; the Lacedæmonians were for the time put under arrest,
but not detained long. Among the Athenian exiles was a person of
noble name and parentage—Iphikrates, son of the great Athenian
officer of that name.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297"
class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The captive Iphikrates not only received
his liberty, but was induced by courteous and honorable treatment
to remain with Alexander. He died however shortly afterwards from
sickness, and his ashes were then collected, by order of Alexander,
to be sent to his family at Athens.</p>

<p>I have already stated in a former volume<a id="FNanchor_298"
href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> that the elder
Iphikrates had been adopted by Alexander’s grandfather into the regal
family of Macedonia, as the savior of their throne: probably this was
the circumstance which determined the superior favor shown to the
son, rather than any sentiment either towards Athens or towards the
military genius of the father. The difference of position, between
Iphikrates the father and Iphikrates the son, is one among the
painful evidences of the downward march of Hellenism; the father, a
distinguished officer moving amidst a circle of freemen, sustaining
by arms the security and dignity of his own fellow-citizens, and even
interfering for the rescue of the Macedonian regal family; the son,
condemned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p. 130]</span>
witness the degradation of his native city by Macedonian arms, and
deprived of all other means of reviving or rescuing her, except
such as could be found in the service of an Oriental prince, whose
stupidity and cowardice threw away at once his own security and the
freedom of Greece.</p>

<p>Master of Damascus and of Kœle-Syria, Alexander advanced onward to
Phenicia. The first Phenician town which he approached was Marathus,
on the mainland opposite the islet of Aradus, forming, along with
that islet and some other neighboring towns, the domain of the
Aradian prince Gerostratus. That prince was himself now serving with
his naval contingent among the Persian fleet in the Ægean; but his
son Strata, acting as viceroy at home, despatched to Alexander his
homage with a golden wreath, and made over to him at once Aradus with
the neighboring towns included in its domain. The example of Strato
was followed, first by the inhabitants of Byblus, the next Phenician
city in a southerly direction; next, by the great city of Sidon, the
queen and parent of all Phenician prosperity. The Sidonians even
sent envoys to meet him and invite his approach.<a id="FNanchor_299"
href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Their sentiments
were unfavorable to the Persians, from remembrance of the bloody
and perfidious proceedings which (about eighteen years before)
had marked the recapture of their city by the armies of Ochus.<a
id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
Nevertheless, the naval contingents both of Byblus and of Sidon (as
well as that of Aradus), were at this moment sailing in the Ægean
with the Persian admiral Autophradates, and formed a large proportion
of his entire fleet.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301"
class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>While Alexander was still at Marathus, however, previous to his
onward march, he received both envoys and a letter from Darius,
asking for the restitution of his mother, wife, and children—and
tendering friendship and alliance, as from one king to another.
Darius farther attempted to show, that the Macedonian Philip had
begun the wrong against Persia,—that Alexander had continued it—and
that he himself (Darius) had acted merely in self-defence. In
reply, Alexander wrote a letter, wherein he set forth his own case
against Darius, proclaiming himself the appointed leader of the
Greeks, to avenge the an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p.
131]</span>cient invasion of Greece by Xerxes. He then alleged
various complaints against Darius, whom he accused of having
instigated the assassination of Philip, as well as the hostilities
of the anti-Macedonian cities in Greece. “Now (continued he), by the
grace of the gods, I have been victorious, first over your satraps,
next over yourself. I have taken care of all who submit to me, and
made them satisfied with their lot. Come yourself to me also, as to
the master of all Asia. Come without fear of suffering harm; ask
me, and you shall receive back your mother and wife, and anything
else which you please. When next you write to me, however, address
me not as an equal, but as lord of Asia and of all that belongs to
you; otherwise I shall deal with you as a wrong-doer. If you intend
to contest the kingdom with me, stand and fight for it, and do not
run away. I shall march forward against you, wherever you may be.”<a
id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>This memorable correspondence, which led to no result, is of
importance only as it marks the character of Alexander, with whom
fighting and conquering were both the business and the luxury of
life, and to whom all assumption of equality and independence with
himself, even on the part of other kings—every thing short of
submission and obedience—appeared in the light of wrong and insult to
be avenged. The recital of comparative injuries, on each side, was
mere unmeaning pretence. The real and only question was (as Alexander
himself had put it in his message to the captive Sisygambis<a
id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>)
which of the two should be master of Asia.</p>

<p>The decision of this question, already sufficiently advanced on
the morrow after the battle of Issus, was placed almost beyond doubt
by the rapid and unopposed successes of Alexander among most of
the Phenician cities. The last hopes of Persia now turned chiefly
upon the sentiments of these Phenicians. The greater part of the
Persian fleet in the Ægean was composed of Phenician triremes,
partly from the coast of Syria, partly from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span> the island of Cyprus. If the Phenician
towns made submission to Alexander, it was certain that their ships
and seamen would either return home spontaneously or be recalled;
thus depriving the Persian quiver of its best remaining arrow. But
if the Phenician towns held out resolutely against him, one and
all, so as to put him under the necessity of besieging them in
succession—each lending aid to the rest by sea, with superiority of
naval force, and more than one of them being situated upon islets—the
obstacles to be overcome would have been so multiplied, that even
Alexander’s energy and ability might hardly have proved sufficient
for them: at any rate, he would have had hard work before him for
perhaps two years, opening the door to many new accidents and
efforts. It was therefore a signal good fortune to Alexander when
the prince of the islet of Aradus spontaneously surrendered to him
that difficult city, and when the example was followed by the still
greater city of Sidon. The Phenicians, taking them generally, had
no positive tie to the Persians; neither had they much confederate
attachment one towards the other, although as separate communities
they were brave and enterprising. Among the Sidonians, there was
even a prevalent feeling of aversion to the Persians, from the cause
above mentioned. Hence the prince of Aradus, upon whom Alexander’s
march first came, had little certainty of aid from his neighbors,
if he resolved to hold out; and still less disposition to hold
out single-handed, after the battle of Issus had proclaimed the
irresistible force of Alexander not less than the impotence of
Persia. One after another, all these important Phenician seaports,
except Tyre, fell into the hands of Alexander without striking a
blow. At Sidon, the reigning prince Strato, reputed as philo-Persian,
was deposed, and a person named Abdalonymus—of the reigning
family, yet poor in circumstances—was appointed in his room.<a
id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>With his usual rapidity, Alexander marched onward towards Tyre;
the most powerful among the Phenician cities, though apparently less
ancient than Sidon. Even on the march, he was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span> met by a deputation from Tyre, composed
of the most eminent men in the city, and headed by the son of the
Tyrian prince Azemilchus, who was himself absent commanding the
Tyrian contingent in the Persian fleet. These men brought large
presents and supplies for the Macedonian army, together with a
golden wreath of honor; announcing formally that the Tyrians were
prepared to do whatever Alexander commanded.<a id="FNanchor_305"
href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In reply, he
commended the dispositions of the city, accepted the presents,
and desired the deputation to communicate at home, that he wished
to enter Tyre and offer sacrifice to Herakles. The Phenician god
Melkart was supposed identical with the Grecian Herakles, and was
thus ancestor of the Macedonian kings. His temple at Tyre was of
the most venerable antiquity; moreover the injunction, to sacrifice
there, is said to have been conveyed to Alexander in an oracle.<a
id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
The Tyrians at home, after deliberating on this message, sent out an
answer declining to comply, and intimating that they would not admit
within their walls either Macedonians or Persians; but that as to all
other points, they would obey Alexander’s orders.<a id="FNanchor_307"
href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> They added that
his wish to sacrifice to Herakles might be accomplished without
entering their city, since there was in Palætyrus (on the
mainland over against the islet of Tyre, separated from it only
by the narrow strait) a temple of that god yet more ancient and
venerable than their own.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308"
class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Incensed at this qualified adhesion,
in which he took note only of the point refused,—Alexander
dismissed the envoys with angry menaces, and immediately resolved
on taking Tyre by force.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309"
class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span>Those who
(like Diodorus) treat such refusal on the part of the Tyrians
as foolish wilfulness,<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310"
class="fnanchor">[310]</a> have not fully considered how much
the demand included. When Alexander made a solemn sacrifice to
Artemis at Ephesus, he marched to her temple with his whole force
armed and in battle army.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311"
class="fnanchor">[311]</a> We cannot doubt that his sacrifice at
Tyre to Herakles—his ancestral Hero, whose especial attribute was
force—would have been celebrated with an array equally formidable, as
in fact it was, after the town had been taken.<a id="FNanchor_312"
href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> The Tyrians were thus
required to admit within their walls an irresistible military force;
which might indeed be withdrawn after the sacrifice was completed,
but which might also remain, either wholly or in part, as permanent
garrison of an almost impregnable position. They had not endured such
treatment from Persia, nor were they disposed to endure it from a new
master. It was in fact hazarding their all; submitting at once to a
fate which might be as bad as could befall them after a successful
siege. On the other hand, when we reflect that the Tyrians promised
everything short of submission to military occupation, we see that
Alexander, had he been so inclined, could have obtained from them
all that was really essential to his purpose, without the necessity
of besieging the town. The great value of Phenician cities consisted
in their fleet, which now acted with the Persians, and gave to them
the command of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313"
class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Had Alexander required that this fleet
should be withdrawn from the Persians and placed in his service,
there can be no doubt that he would have obtained it readily.
The Tyrians had no motive to devote themselves for Persia, nor
did they probably (as Arrian supposes) attempt to trim between
the two belligerents, as if the contest were still undecided.<a
id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Yet
rather than hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>
over their city to the chances of a Macedonian soldiery, they
resolved to brave the hazards of a siege. The pride of Alexander,
impatient of opposition even to his most extreme demands, prompted
him to take a step politically unprofitable, in order to make display
of his power, by degrading and crushing, with or without a siege, one
of the most ancient, spirited, wealthy and intelligent communities of
the ancient world.</p>

<p>Tyre was situated on an islet nearly half a mile from
the mainland;<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315"
class="fnanchor">[315]</a> the channel between the two being shallow
towards the land, but reaching a depth of eighteen feet in the part
adjoining the city. The islet was completely surrounded by prodigious
walls, the loftiest portion of which, on the side fronting the
mainland, reached a height not less than 150 feet, with corresponding
solidity and base.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316"
class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Besides these external fortifications,
there was a brave and numerous population within, aided by a good
stock of arms, machines, ships, provisions, and other things
essential to defence.</p>

<p>It was not without reason, therefore, that the Tyrians, when
driven to their last resource, entertained hopes of holding out even
against the formidable arm of Alexander; and against Alexander as
he then stood, they might have held out successfully; for he had as
yet no fleet, and they could defy any attack made simply from land.
The question turned upon the Phenician and Cyprian ships, which
were for the most part (the Tyrian among them) in the Ægean under
the Persian admiral. Alexander—master as he was of Aradus, Byblus,
Sidon, and all the Phenician cities except Tyre—calculated that the
seamen belonging to these cities would follow their countrymen at
home and bring away their ships to join him. He hoped also, as the
victorious potentate, to draw to himself the willing adhesion<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span> of the Cyprian cities.
This could hardly have failed to happen if he had treated the Tyrians
with decent consideration; but it was no longer certain, now that he
had made them his enemies.</p>

<p>What passed among the Persian fleet under Autophradates in the
Ægean, when they were informed, first that Alexander was master of
the other Phenician cities; next, that he was commencing the siege of
Tyre—we know very imperfectly. The Tyrian prince Azemilchus brought
home his ships for the defence of his own city;<a id="FNanchor_317"
href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> the Sidonian and
Aradian ships also went home, no longer serving against a power to
whom their own cities had submitted; but the Cyprians hesitated
longer before they declared themselves. If Darius, or even
Autophradates without Darius, instead of abandoning Tyre altogether
(as they actually did), had energetically aided the resistance which
it offered to Alexander, as the interests of Persia dictated—the
Cypriot ships might not improbably have been retained on that side in
the struggle. Lastly, the Tyrians might indulge a hope, that their
Phenician brethren, if ready to serve Alexander against Persia, would
be nowise hearty as his instruments for crushing a kindred city.
These contingencies, though ultimately they all turned out in favor
of Alexander, were in the beginning sufficiently promising to justify
the intrepid resolution of the Tyrians; who were farther encouraged
by promises of aid from the powerful fleets of their colony Carthage.
To that city, whose deputies were then within their walls for some
religious solemnities, they sent many of their wives and children.<a
id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Alexander began the siege of Tyre without any fleet; the Sidonian
and Aradian ships not having yet come. It was his first<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span> task to construct a
solid mole two hundred feet broad, reaching across the half mile
channel between the mainland and the islet. He pressed into his
service laboring hands by thousands from the neighborhood; he had
stones in abundance from Palætyrus, and wood from the forests in
Lebanon. But the work, though prosecuted with ardor and perseverance,
under pressing instigations from Alexander, was tedious and toilsome,
even near the mainland, where the Tyrians could do little to impede
it; and became far more tedious as it advanced into the sea, so as
to be exposed to their obstruction, as well as to damage from winds
and waves. The Tyrian triremes and small boats perpetually annoyed
the workmen, and destroyed parts of the work, in spite of all the
protection devised by the Macedonians, who planted two towers in
front of their advancing mole, and discharged projectiles from
engines provided for the purpose. At length, by unremitting efforts,
the mole was pushed forward until it came nearly across the channel
to the city wall; when suddenly, on a day of strong wind, the Tyrians
sent forth a fireship loaded with combustibles, which they drove
against the front of the mole and set fire to the two towers. At
the same time, the full naval force of the city, ships and little
boats, was sent forth to land men at once on all parts of the mole.
So successful was this attack, that all the Macedonian engines were
burnt,—the outer wood-work which kept the mole together was torn up
in many places,—and a large part of the structure came to pieces.<a
id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Alexander had thus not only to construct fresh engines, but also
to begin the mole nearly anew. He resolved to give it greater breadth
and strength, for the purpose of carrying more towers abreast in
front, and for better defence against lateral attacks. But it had
now become plain to him, that while the Tyrians were masters of the
sea, no efforts by land alone would enable him to take the town.
Leaving Perdikkas and Kraterus to reconstruct the mole and build new
engines, he himself repaired to Sidon, for the purpose of assembling
as large a fleet as he could. He got together triremes from various
quarters—two from Rhodes, ten from the seaports in Lykia, three from
Soli and Mallus. But his principal force was obtained by putting
in requisi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>tion
the ships of the Phenician towns, Sidon, Byblus, and Aradus, now
subject to him. These ships, eighty in number, had left the Persian
admiral and come to Sidon, there awaiting his orders; while not long
afterwards, the princes of Cyprus came thither also, tendering to
him their powerful fleet of 120 ships of war.<a id="FNanchor_320"
href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> He was now master of
a fleet of 200 sail, comprising the most part and the best part, of
the Persian navy. This was the consummation of Macedonian triumph—the
last real and effective weapon wrested from the grasp of Persia.
The prognostic afforded by the eagle near the ships at Miletus, as
interpreted by Alexander, had now been fulfilled; since by successful
operations on land, he had conquered and brought into his power a
superior Persian fleet.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321"
class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>Having directed these ships to complete their equipments and
training, with Macedonians as soldiers on board, Alexander put
himself at the head of some light troops for an expedition of eleven
days against the Arabian mountaineers on Libanus, whom he dispersed
or put down, though not without some personal exposure and hazard.<a
id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> On
returning to Sidon, he found Kleander arrived with a reinforcement
of 4000 Grecian hoplites, welcome auxiliaries for prosecuting the
siege. Then, going aboard his fleet in the harbor of Sidon, he sailed
with it in good battle order to Tyre, hoping that the Tyrians would
come out and fight. But they kept within, struck with surprise and
consternation; having not before known that their fellow-Phenicians
were now among the besiegers. Alexander, having ascertained that
the Tyrians would not accept a sea-fight, immediately caused their
two harbors to be blocked up and watched; that on the north,
towards Sidon, by the Cyprians—that on the south, towards Egypt,
by the Phenicians.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323"
class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span>From this
time forward, the doom of Tyre was certain. The Tyrians could no
longer offer obstruction to the mole, which was completed across
the channel and brought up to the town. Engines were planted upon
it to batter the walls: movable towers were rolled up to take them
by assault; attack was also made from seaward. Yet though reduced
altogether to the defensive, the Tyrians still displayed obstinate
bravery, and exhausted all the resources of ingenuity in repelling
the besiegers. So gigantic was the strength of the wall fronting the
mole, and even that of the northern side fronting Sidon, that none
of Alexander’s engines could make any breach in it; but on the south
side towards Egypt he was more successful. A large breach having been
made in this south-wall, he assaulted it with two ships manned by
the hypaspists and the soldiers of his phalanx: he himself commanded
in one and Admêtus in the other. At the same time he caused the
town to be menaced all round, at every approachable point, for the
purpose of distracting the attention of the defenders. Himself and
his two ships having been rowed close up to the breach in the south
wall, boarding bridges were thrown out from each deck, upon which he
and Admêtus rushed forward with their respective storming-parties.
Admêtus got upon the wall, but was there slain; Alexander also was
among the first to mount, and the two parties got such a footing on
the wall as to overpower all resistance. At the same time, his ships
also forced their way into the two harbors, so that Tyre came on
all sides into his power.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324"
class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>Though the walls were now lost, and resistance had become
desperate, the gallant defenders did not lose their courage. They
barricaded the streets, and concentrated their strength especially
at a defensible post called the Agenorion, or chapel of Agenor. Here
the battle again raged furiously until they were overpowered by the
Macedonians, incensed with the long toils of the previous siege, as
well as by the slaughter of some of their prisoners, whom the Tyrians
had killed publicly on the battlements. All who took shelter in the
temple of Hêraklês were spared by Alexander from respect to the
sanctuary: among the number were the prince Azemilchus, a few leading
Tyrians, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>
Carthaginian envoys, and some children of both sexes. The Sidonians
also, displaying a tardy sentiment of kindred, and making partial
amends for the share which they had taken in the capture, preserved
some lives from the sword of the conqueror.<a id="FNanchor_325"
href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> But the greater
number of the adult freemen perished with arms in their hands;
while 2000 of them who survived, either from disabling wounds, or
from the fatigue of the slaughterers, were hanged on the sea-shore
by order of Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326"
class="fnanchor">[326]</a> The females, the children, and the
slaves, were sold to the slave-merchant. The number sold is said
to have been about 30,000: a total rather small, as we must assume
slaves to be included; but we are told that many had been previously
sent away to Carthage.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327"
class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>Thus master of Tyre, Alexander marched into the city and
consummated his much-desired sacrifice to Herakles. His whole
force, land and naval, fully armed and arrayed, took part in the
procession. A more costly hecatomb had never been offered to that
god, when we consider that it had been purchased by all the toils
of an unnecessary siege, and by the extirpation of these free and
high-spirited citizens, his former worshippers. What the loss of the
Macedonians had been, we cannot say. The number of their slain is
stated by Arrian at 400, which must be greatly beneath the truth;
for the courage and skill of the besieged had prolonged the siege
to the prodigious period of seven months, though Alexander had
left no means untried to accomplish it sooner.<a id="FNanchor_328"
href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>Towards the close of the siege of Tyre, Alexander received and
rejected a second proposition from Darius, offering 10,000 talents,
with the cession of all the territory westward of the Euphrates, as
ransom for his mother and wife, and proposing that Alexander should
become his son-in-law as well as his ally. “If I were Alexander
(said Parmenio) I should accept such terms,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> instead of plunging into farther
peril.”—“So would I (replied Alexander) if I were Parmenio; but
since I am Alexander, I must return a different answer.” His answer
to Darius was to this effect—“I want neither your money nor your
cession. All your money and territory are already mine, and you
are tendering to me a part in place of the whole. If I choose to
marry your daughter, I <i>shall</i> marry her—whether you give her
to me or not. Come hither to me, if you wish to obtain from me
any act of friendship.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329"
class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Alexander might spare the submissive and
the prostrate; but he could not brook an equal or a competitor, and
his language towards them was that of brutal insolence. Of course
this was the last message sent by Darius, who now saw, if he had not
before seen, that he had no chance open except by the renewal of
war.</p>

<p>Being thus entire master of Syria, Phenicia, and Palestine, and
having accepted the voluntary submission of the Jews, Alexander
marched forward to conquer Egypt. He had determined, before he
undertook any farther expedition into the interior of the Persian
empire, to make himself master of all the coast-lands which kept
open the communications of the Persians with Greece, so as to secure
his rear against any serious hostility. His great fear was, of
Grecian soldiers or cities raised against him by Persian gold;<a
id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
and Egypt was the last remaining possession of the Persians,
which gave them the means of acting upon Greece. Those means
were indeed now prodigiously curtailed by the feeble condition
of the Persian fleet in the Ægean, unable to contend with
the increasing fleet of the Macedonian admirals Hegelochus
and Amphoterus, now numbering 160 sail.<a id="FNanchor_331"
href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> During the summer
of 332 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, while Alexander was prosecuting
the siege of Tyre, these admirals recovered all the important
acquisitions—Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos—which had been made by
Memnon for the Persian interests. The inhabi<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>tants of Tenedos invited them and
ensured their success; those of Chios attempted to do the same,
but were coerced by Pharnabazus, who retained the city by means
of his insular partisans, Apollonides and others, with a military
force. The Macedonian admirals laid siege to the town, and were
presently enabled to carry it by their friends within. Pharnabazus
was here captured with his entire force; twelve triremes thoroughly
armed and manned, thirty store-ships, several privateers, and
3000 Grecian mercenaries. Aristonikus, philo-Persian despot of
Methymna—arriving at Chios shortly afterwards, but ignorant of the
capture—was entrapped into the harbor, and made prisoner. There
remained only Mitylênê, which was held for the Persians by the
Athenian Chares, with a garrison of 2000 men; who, however, seeing no
hope of holding out against the Macedonians, consented to evacuate
the city on condition of a free departure. The Persians were thus
expelled from the sea, from all footing among the Grecian islands,
and from the vicinity of Greece and Macedonia.<a id="FNanchor_332"
href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>These successes were in full progress, when Alexander himself
directed his march from Tyre to Egypt, stopping in his way to
besiege Gaza. This considerable town, the last before entering on
the desert track between Syria and Egypt, was situated between one
and two miles from the sea. It was built upon a lofty artificial
mound, and encircled with a high wall; but its main defence was
derived from the deep sands immediately around it, as well as from
the mud and quicksand on its coast. It was defended by a brave man,
the eunuch Batis, with a strong garrison of Arabs, and abundant
provision of every kind. Confiding in the strength of the place,
Batis refused to admit Alexander. Moreover his judgment was confirmed
by the Macedonian engineers themselves, who, when Alexander first
surveyed the walls, pronounced it to be impregnable, chiefly from
the height of its supporting mound. But Alexander could not endure
the thought of tacitly confessing his inability to take Gaza. The
more difficult the enterprise, the greater was the charm for him,
and the greater would be the astonishment<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span> produced all around when he should be
seen to have triumphed.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333"
class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>He began by erecting a mound south of the city, close by the
wall, for the purpose of bringing up his battering engines. This
external mound was completed, and the engines had begun to batter
the wall, when a well-planned sally by the garrison overthrew the
assailants and destroyed the engines. The timely aid of Alexander
himself with his hypaspists, protected their retreat; but he
himself, after escaping a snare from a pretended Arabian deserter,
received a severe wound through the shield and the breastplate into
the shoulder, by a dart discharged from a catapult; as the prophet
Aristander had predicted—giving assurance at the same time, that Gaza
would fall into his hands.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334"
class="fnanchor">[334]</a> During the treatment of his wound, he
ordered the engines employed at Tyre to be brought up by sea; and
caused his mound to be carried around the whole circumference of
the town, so as to render it approachable from every point. This
Herculean work, the description of which we read with astonishment,
was 250 feet high all round, and two stadia (1240 feet) broad<a
id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>;
the loose sand around could hardly have been suitable, so that
materials must have been brought up from a distance. The undertaking
was at length completed; in what length of time we do not know,
but it must have been considerable—though doubtless thousands of
laborers would be pressed in from the circumjacent country.<a
id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>Gaza was now
attacked at all points by battering-rams, by mines, and by projectile
engines with various missiles. Presently the Walls were breached
in several places, though the defenders were unremitting in their
efforts to repair the damaged parts. Alexander attempted three
distinct general assaults; but in all three he was repulsed by the
bravery of the Gazæans. At length, after still farther breaching
the wall, he renewed for the fourth time his attempt to storm. The
entire Macedonian phalanx being brought up to attack at different
points, the greatest emulation reigned among the officers. The Æakid
Neoptolemus was first to mount the wall; but the other divisions
manifested hardly less ardor, and the town was at length taken. Its
gallant defenders resisted, with unabated spirit, to the last; and
all fell in their posts, the incensed soldiery being no way disposed
to give quarter.</p>

<p>One prisoner alone was reserved for special treatment—the prince
or governor himself, the eunuch Batis; who, having manifested the
greatest energy and valor, was taken severely wounded, yet still
alive. In this condition he was brought by Leonatus and Philôtas into
the presence of Alexander, who cast upon him looks of vengeance and
fury. The Macedonian prince had undertaken the siege mainly in order
to prove to the world that he could overcome difficulties insuperable
to others. But he had incurred so much loss, spent so much time and
labor, and undergone so many repulses before he succeeded,—that the
palm of honor belonged rather to the minority vanquished than to
the multitude of victors. To such disappointment, which would sting
Alexander in the tenderest point, is to be added the fact, that
he had himself incurred great personal risk and received a severe
wound. Here was ample ground for violent anger; which was moreover
still farther exasperated by the appearance of Batis—an eunuch—a
black man—tall and robust, but at the same time fat and lumpish—and
doubtless at the moment covered with blood and dirt. Such visible
circumstances, repulsive to eyes familiar with Grecian gymnastics,
contributed to kindle the wrath of Alexander to its highest pitch.
After the siege of Tyre, his indignation had been satiated by the
hanging of the 2000 surviving combatants; here, to discharge the
pressure of a still stronger feeling, there remained only the single
captive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span> upon
whom therefore he resolved to inflict a punishment as novel as it
was cruel. He directed the feet of Batis to be bored, and brazen
rings to be passed through them; after which the naked body of this
brave man, yet surviving, was tied with cords to the tail of a
chariot driven by Alexander himself, and dragged at full speed amidst
the triumphant jeers and shouts of the army.<a id="FNanchor_337"
href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Herein Alexander,
emulous even from childhood of the exploits of his legendary
ancestor Achilles, copied the ignominious treatment described in the
Iliad as inflicted on the dead body of Hektor.<a id="FNanchor_338"
href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>This proceeding of Alexander, the product of Homeric reminiscences
operating upon an infuriated and vindictive temperament, stands
out in respect of barbarity from all that we read respecting the
treatment of conquered towns in antiquity. His remaining measures
were conformable to received usage. The wives and children of the
Gazæans were sold into slavery. New inhabitants were admitted from
the neighborhood, and a garrison was placed there to hold the town
for the Macedonians.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>The two sieges of Tyre and Gaza, which occupied both
together nine mouths,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340"
class="fnanchor">[340]</a> were the hardest fighting that Alexander
had ever encountered, or in fact ever did encounter throughout his
life. After such toils, the march to Egypt, which he now<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span> commenced (October 332
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), was an affair of holiday and
triumph. Mazakes, the satrap of Egypt, having few Persian troops
and a disaffected native population, was noway disposed to resist
the approaching conqueror. Seven days’ march brought Alexander and
his army from Gaza to Pelusium, the frontier fortress of Egypt,
commanding the eastern branch of the Nile, whither his fleet, under
the command of Hephæstion, had come also. Here he found not only
open gates and a submissive governor, but also crowds of Egyptians
assembled to welcome him.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341"
class="fnanchor">[341]</a> He placed a garrison in Pelusium, sent
his fleet up the river to Memphis, and marched himself to the same
place by land. The satrap Mazakes surrendered himself, with all
the treasure in the city, 800 talents in amount, and much precious
furniture. Here Alexander reposed some time, offering splendid
sacrifices to the gods generally, and especially to the Egyptian god
Apis; to which he added gymnastic and musical matches, sending to
Greece for the most distinguished artists.</p>

<p>From Memphis, he descended the westernmost branch of the Nile
to Kanôpus at its mouth, from whence he sailed westerly along the
shore to look at the island of Pharos, celebrated in Homer, and the
lake Mareôtis. Reckoning Egypt now as a portion of his empire, and
considering that the business of keeping down an unquiet population,
as well as of collecting a large revenue, would have to be performed
by his extraneous land and sea force, he saw the necessity of
withdrawing the seat of government from Memphis, where both the
Persians and the natives had maintained it, and of founding a new
city of his own on the seaboard, convenient for communication with
Greece and Macedonia. His imagination, susceptible to all Homeric
impressions and influenced by a dream, first fixed upon the isle of
Pharos as a suitable place for his intended city.<a id="FNanchor_342"
href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Perceiving soon,
however, that this little isle was inadequate by itself, he included
it as part of a larger city to be founded on the adjacent mainland.
The gods were consulted, and encouraging responses were obtained;
upon which Alexander himself marked out the circuit of the walls,
the direction of the principal streets,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> and the sites of numerous temples
to Grecian gods as well as Egyptian.<a id="FNanchor_343"
href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> It was thus that the
first stone was laid of the mighty, populous, and busy Alexandria;
which however the founder himself never lived to see, and wherein
he was only destined to repose as a corpse. The site of the place,
between the sea and the Lake Mareôtis, was found airy and healthy,
as well as convenient for shipping and commerce. The protecting
island of Pharos gave the means of forming two good harbors for
ships coming by sea, on a coast harborless elsewhere; while the
Lake Mareôtis, communicating by various canals with the river Nile,
received with facility the exportable produce from the interior.<a
id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
As soon as houses were ready, commencement was made by transporting
to them in mass the population of the neighboring town of Kanôpus,
and probably of other towns besides, by the intendant Kleomenes.<a
id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>Alexandria became afterwards the capital of the Ptolemaic princes.
It acquired immense grandeur and population during their rule of two
centuries and a half, when their enormous revenues were spent greatly
in its improvement and decoration. But we cannot reasonably ascribe
to Alexander himself any prescience of such an imposing future.
He intended it as a place from which he could conveniently rule
Egypt, considered as a portion of his extensive empire all round the
Ægean; and had Egypt remained thus a fraction, instead of becoming
a substantive imperial whole, Alexandria would probably not have
risen beyond mediocrity.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346"
class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>The other most notable incident, which distinguished the four or
five months’ stay of Alexander in Egypt, was his march through the
sandy desert to the temple of Zeus Ammon. This is chiefly memorable
as it marks his increasing self-adoration and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span> inflation above the limits of humanity.
His achievements during the last three years had so transcended the
expectations of every one, himself included—the gods had given to
him such incessant good fortune, and so paralyzed or put down his
enemies—that the hypothesis of a superhuman personality seemed the
natural explanation of such a superhuman career.<a id="FNanchor_347"
href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> He had to look back
to the heroic legends, and to his ancestors Perseus and Herakles, to
find a worthy prototype.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348"
class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Conceiving himself to be (like them) the
son of Zeus, with only a nominal human parentage, he resolved to
go and ascertain the fact by questioning the infallible oracle of
Zeus Ammon. His march of several days, through a sandy desert—always
fatiguing, sometimes perilous, was distinguished by manifest
evidences of the favor of the gods. Unexpected rain fell just when
the thirsty soldiers required water. When the guides lost their
track, from shifting of the sand, on a sudden two speaking serpents,
or two ravens, appeared preceding the march and indicating the right
direction. Such were the statements made by Ptolemy, Aristobulus,
and Kallisthenes, companions and contemporaries; while Arrian,
four centuries afterwards, announces his positive conviction that
there was a divine intervention on behalf of Alexander, though
he cannot satisfy himself about the details.<a id="FNanchor_349"
href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The priest of
Zeus Ammon addressed Alexander, as being the son of the god, and
farther assured him that his career would be one of uninterrupted
victory, until he was taken away to the gods; while his friends
also, who consulted the oracle for their own satisfaction, received
for answer that the rendering of divine honors to him would be
acceptable to Zeus. After profuse sacrifices and presents, Alexander
quitted the oracle, with a full and sincere faith that he really
was the son of Zeus Ammon; which faith was farther confirmed by
declarations transmitted to him from other oracles—that of Erythræ
in Io<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span>nia, and
of Branchidæ near Miletus.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350"
class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Though he did not directly order himself
to be addressed as the son of Zeus, he was pleased with those who
volunteered such a recognition, and angry with sceptics or scoffers,
who disbelieved the oracle of Ammon. Plutarch thinks that this was a
mere political manœuvre of Alexander, for the purpose of overawing
the non-Hellenic population over whom he was enlarging his empire.<a
id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
But it seems rather to have been a genuine faith,—a simple
exaggeration of that exorbitant vanity which from the beginning
reigned so largely in his bosom. He was indeed aware that it was
repugnant to the leading Macedonians in many ways, but especially
as a deliberate insult to the memory of Philip. This is the theme
always touched upon in moments of dissatisfaction. To Parmenio, to
Philôtas, to Kleitus, and other principal officers, the insolence of
the king in disclaiming Philip and putting himself above the level
of humanity, appeared highly offensive. Discontents on this subject
among the Macedonian officers, though condemned to silence by fear
and admiration of Alexander, became serious, and will be found

<p>The last month of Alexander’s stay in Egypt was passed at Memphis.
While nominating various officers for the permanent administration
of the country, he also received a visit of Hegelochus his admiral,
who brought as prisoners Aristonikus of Methymna, and other despots
of the various insular Grecian cities. Alexander ordered them
to be handed over to their respective cities, to be dealt with
as the citizens pleased; all except the Chian Apollonides, who
was sent to Elephantinê in the south of Egypt for detention. In
most of the cities, the despots had incurred such violent hatred,
that when delivered up, they were tortured and put to death.<a
id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
Pharnabazus also had been among<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> the prisoners, but had found means
to escape from his guards when the fleet touched at Kos.<a
id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>In the early spring, after receiving reinforcements of Greeks
and Thracians, Alexander marched into Phenicia. It was there that
he regulated the affairs of Phenicia, Syria, and Greece, prior
to his intended expedition into the interior against Darius. He
punished the inhabitants of Samaria, who had revolted and burnt
alive the Macedonian prefect Andromachus.<a id="FNanchor_355"
href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> In addition to all
the business transacted, Alexander made costly presents to the
Tyrian Herakles, and offered splendid sacrifices to other gods.
Choice festivals with tragedy were also celebrated, analogous to the
Dionysia at Athens, with the best actors and chorists contending for
the prize. The princes of Cyprus vied with each other in doing honor
to the son of Zeus Ammon; each undertaking the duty of chorêgus,
getting up at his own cost a drama with distinguished chorus and
actors, and striving to obtain the prize from pre-appointed judges—as
was practised among the ten tribes at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_356"
href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of these religious and festive exhibitions, Alexander
was collecting magazines for his march into the interior.<a
id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> He
had already sent forward a detachment to Thapsacus, the usual ford of
the Euphrates, to throw bridges over the river. The Persian Mazæus
was on guard on the other side, with a small force of 3000 men, 2000
of them Greeks; not sufficient to hinder the bridges from being
built, but only to hinder them from being carried completely over to
the left bank. After eleven days of march from Phenicia, Alexander
and his whole army reached Thapsakus. Mazæus, on the other side,
as soon as he saw the main army arrive, withdrew his small force
without delay, and retreated to the Tigris; so that the two bridges
were completed, and Alexander crossed forthwith.<a id="FNanchor_358"
href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p>Once over the Euphrates, Alexander had the option of marching
down the left bank of that river to Babylon, the chief city
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> the Persian
empire, and the natural place to find Darius.<a id="FNanchor_359"
href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> But this march (as
we know from Xenophon, who made it with the Ten Thousand Greeks)
would be one of extreme suffering and through a desert country
where no provisions were to be got. Moreover, Mazæus in retreating
had taken a north-easterly direction towards the upper part of the
Tigris; and some prisoners reported that Darius with his main army
was behind the Tigris, intending to defend the passage of that river
against Alexander. The Tigris appears not to be fordable below
Nineveh (Mosul). Accordingly he directed his march, first nearly
northward, having the Euphrates on his left hand; next eastward
across Northern Mesopotamia, having the Armenian mountains on his
left hand. On reaching the ford of the Tigris, he found it absolutely
undefended. Not a single enemy being in sight, he forded the river
as soon as possible, with all his infantry, cavalry, and baggage.
The difficulties and perils of crossing were extreme, from the depth
of the water, above their breasts, the rapidity of the current,
and the slippery footing.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360"
class="fnanchor">[360]</a> A resolute and vigilant enemy might
have rendered the passage almost impossible. But the good fortune
of Alexander was not less conspicuous in what his enemies left
undone, than in what they actually did.<a id="FNanchor_361"
href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>After this fatiguing passage, Alexander rested for two days.
During the night an eclipse of the moon occurred, nearly total; which
spread consternation among the army, combined with complaints against
his overweening insolence, and mistrust as to the unknown regions on
which they were entering.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p.
152]</span> Alexander, while offering solemn sacrifices to Sun,
Moon, and Earth, combated the prevailing depression by declarations
from his own prophet Aristander and from Egyptian astrologers,
who proclaimed that Helios favored the Greeks, and Selênê the
Persians; hence the eclipse of the moon portended victory to the
Macedonians—and victory too (so Aristander promised), before the
next new moon. Having thus reassured the soldiers, Alexander marched
for four days in a south-easterly direction through the territory
called Aturia, with the Tigris on his right hand, and the Gordyene
or Kurd mountains on his left. Encountering a small advanced guard
of the Persians, he here learnt from prisoners that Darius with his
main host was not far off.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362"
class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Nearly two years had elapsed since the ruinous defeat of Issus.
What Darius had been doing during this long interval, and especially
during the first half of it, we are unable to say. We hear only
of one proceeding on his part—his missions, twice repeated, to
Alexander, tendering or entreating peace, with the especial view of
recovering his captive family. Nothing else does he appear to have
done, either to retrieve the losses of the past, or to avert the
perils of the future; nothing, to save his fleet from passing into
the hands of the conqueror; nothing, to relieve either Tyre or Gaza,
the sieges of which collectively occupied Alexander for near ten
months. The disgraceful flight of Darius at Issus had already lost
him the confidence of several of his most valuable servants. The
Macedonian exile Amyntas, a brave and energetic man, with the best
of the Grecian mercenaries, gave up the Persian cause as lost,<a
id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> and
tried to set up for himself, in which attempt he failed and perished
in Egypt. The satrap of Egypt, penetrated with contempt for the
timidity of his master, was induced, by that reason as well as by
others, to throw open the country to Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_364"
href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Having incurred so
deplorable a loss, as well in reputation as in territory, Darius had
the strongest motives to redeem it by augmented vigor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span>But he was
paralyzed by the fact, that his mother, his wife, and several of
his children, had fallen into the hands of the conqueror. Among
the countless advantages growing out of the victory of Issus, this
acquisition was not the least. It placed Darius in the condition
of one who had given hostages for good behavior to his enemy. The
Persian kings were often in the habit of exacting from satraps
or generals the deposit of their wives and families, as a pledge
for fidelity; and Darius himself had received this guarantee from
Memnon, as a condition of entrusting him with the Persian fleet.<a
id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
Bound by the like chains himself, towards one who had now become his
superior, Darius was afraid to act with energy, lest success should
bring down evil upon his captive family. By allowing Alexander to
subdue unopposed all the territory west of the Euphrates, he hoped
to be allowed to retain his empire eastward, and to ransom back
his family at an enormous price. Such propositions did satisfy
Parmenio, and would probably have satisfied even Philip, had
Philip been the victor. The insatiate nature of Alexander had not
yet been fully proved. It was only when the latter contemptuously
rejected everything short of surrender at discretion, that Darius
began to take measures east of the Euphrates for defending what yet
remained.</p>

<p>The conduct of Alexander towards the regal hostages, honorable as
it was to his sentiment, evinced at the same time that he knew their
value as a subject of political negotiation.<a id="FNanchor_366"
href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> It was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> essential that he
should treat them with the full deference due to their rank, if he
desired to keep up their price as hostages in the eyes of Darius
as well as of his own army. He carried them along with his army,
from the coast of Syria, over the bridge of the Euphrates, and even
through the waters of the Tigris. To them, this must have proved a
severe toil; and in fact, the queen Statira became so worn out that
she died shortly after crossing the Tigris;<a id="FNanchor_367"
href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> to him also, it
must have been an onerous obligation, since he not only sought to
ensure to them all their accustomed pomp, but must have assigned a
considerable guard to watch them, at a moment when he was marching
into an unknown country, and required all his military resources to
be disposable. Simply for safe detention, the hostages would have
been better guarded and might have been treated with still greater
ceremony, in a city or a fortress. But Alexander probably wished to
have them near him, in case of the possible contingency of serious
reverses to his army on the eastern side of the Tigris. Assuming such
a misfortune to happen, the surrender of them might ensure a safe
retreat under circumstances otherwise fatal to its accomplishment.</p>

<p>Being at length convinced that Alexander would not be satisfied
with any prize short of the entire Persian empire, Darius summoned
all his forces to defend what he still retained. He brought together
a host said to be superior in number to that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span> which had been defeated at Issus.<a
id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
Contingents arrived from the farthest extremities of the vast Persian
territory—from the Caspian sea, the rivers Oxus and Indus, the
Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea. The plains eastward of the Tigris,
about the latitude of the modern town of Mosul, between that river
and the Gordyene mountains (Zagros), were fixed upon for the muster
of this prodigious multitude; partly conducted by Darius himself from
Babylon, partly arriving there by different routes from the north,
east, and south. Arbêla—a considerable town about twenty miles east
of the Great Zab river, still known under the name of Erbil, as a
caravan station on the ordinary road between Erzeroum and Bagdad—was
fixed on as the muster-place or head-quarters, where the chief
magazines were collected and the heavy baggage lodged, and near which
the troops were first assembled and exercised.<a id="FNanchor_369"
href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>But the spot predetermined for a pitched battle was, the
neighborhood of Gaugamela near the river Bumôdus, about thirty miles
west of Arbêla, towards the Tigris, and about as much south-east
of Mosul—a spacious and level plain, with nothing more than a few
undulating slopes, and without any trees. It was by nature well
adapted for drawing up a numerous army, especially for the free
manœuvres of cavalry, and the rush of scythed chariots; moreover, the
Persian officers had been careful beforehand to level artificially
such of the slopes as they thought inconvenient.<a id="FNanchor_370"
href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> There seemed every
thing in the ground to favor the operation both of the vast total,
and the special forces, of Darius; who fancied that his defeat
at Issus had been occasioned altogether by his having adventured
himself in the narrow defiles of Kilikia—and that on open and level
ground his superior numbers must be triumphant. He was even anxious
that Alexander should come and attack him on the plain. Hence the
undefended passage of the Tigris.</p>

<p>For those who looked only to numbers, the host assembled
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span> Arbêla
might well inspire confidence; for it is said to have consisted
of 1,000,000 of infantry<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371"
class="fnanchor">[371]</a>—40,000 cavalry—200 scythed chariots—and
fifteen elephants; of which animals we now read for the first time
in a field of battle. But besides the numbers, Darius had provided
for his troops more effective arms; instead of mere javelins, strong
swords and short thrusting pikes, such as the Macedonian cavalry
wielded so admirably in close combat—together with shields for the
infantry and breastplates for the horsemen.<a id="FNanchor_372"
href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> He counted much
also on the terrific charge of the chariots, each of which had a
pole projecting before the horses and terminating in a sharp point,
together with three sword-blades stretching from the yoke on each
side, and scythes also laterally from the naves of the wheels.<a
id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>Informed of the approach of Alexander, about the time when the
Macedonian army first reached the Tigris, Darius moved from Arbêla,
where his baggage and treasure were left—crossed by bridges the river
Lykus or Great Zab, an operation which occupied five days—and marched
to take post on the prepared ground near Gaugamela. His battle array
was formed—of the Baktrians on the extreme left, under command of
Bessus the satrap of Baktria; next, the Dahæ and Arachôti, under
command of Barsäentes, satrap of Arachosia; then the native Persians,
horse and foot alternating—the Susians, under Oxathres,—and the
Kadusians. On the extreme right were the contingents of Syria both
east and west of the Euphrates, under Mazæus; then the Medes, under
Atropates; next, the Parthians, Sakæ, Tapyrians, and Hyrkanians,
all cavalry, under Phrata<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p.
157]</span>phernes; then the Albanians and the Sakesinæ. Darius
himself was in the centre, with the choice troops of the army near
and around him—the Persian select Horse-guards, called the king’s
kinsmen—the Persian foot-guards, carrying pikes with a golden apple
at the butt-end—a regiment of Karians, or descendants of Karians,
who had been abstracted from their homes and planted as colonists in
the interior of the empire—the contingent of Mardi, good archers—and
lastly, the mercenary Greeks, of number unknown, in whom Darius
placed his greatest confidence.</p>

<p>Such was the first or main line of the Persians. In the rear of
it stood deep masses of Babylonians,—inhabitants of Sittakê down to
the Persian Gulf—Uxians, from the territory adjoining Susiana to the
east—and others in unknown multitude. In front of it were posted the
scythed chariots, with small advanced bodies of cavalry—Scythians
and Baktrians on the left, with one hundred chariots—Armenians
and Kappadokians on the right, with fifty more—and the remaining
fifty chariots in front of the centre.<a id="FNanchor_374"
href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>Alexander had advanced within about seven miles of the Persian
army, and four days’ march since his crossing the Tigris—when he
first learnt from Persian prisoners how near his enemies were. He at
once halted, established on the spot a camp with ditch and stockade;
and remained there for four days, in order that the soldiers might
repose. On the night of the fourth day, he moved forward, yet
leaving under guard in the camp the baggage, the prisoners, and the
ineffectives. He began his march, over a range of low elevations
which divided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span>
him from the enemy, hoping to approach and attack them at daybreak.
But his progress was so retarded, that day broke, and the two
armies first came in sight, when he was still on the descending
slope of the ground, more than three miles distant. On seeing the
enemy, he halted, and called together his principal officers, to
consult whether he should not prosecute his march and commence
the attack forthwith.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375"
class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Though most of them pronounced for the
affirmative, yet Parmenio contended that this course would be rash;
that the ground before them, with all its difficulties, natural or
artificial, was unknown, and that the enemy’s position, which they
now saw for the first time, ought to be carefully reconnoitred.
Adopting this latter view, Alexander halted for the day; yet still
retaining his battle order, and forming a new entrenched camp, to
which the baggage and the prisoners were now brought forward from the
preceding day’s encampment.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376"
class="fnanchor">[376]</a> He himself spent the day, with an escort
of cavalry and light troops, in reconnoitring both the intermediate
ground and the enemy, who did not interrupt him, in spite of
their immense superiority in cavalry. Parmenio, with Polysperchon
and others, advised him to attack the enemy in the night; which
promised some advantages, since Persian armies were notoriously
unmanageable by night,<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377"
class="fnanchor">[377]</a> and since their camp had no defence.
But on the other hand, the plan involved so many disadvantages and
perils, that Alexander rejected it; declaring—with an emphasis
intentionally enhanced, since he spoke in the hearing of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> many others—that he
disdained the meanness of stealing a victory; that he both would
conquer, and could conquer, Darius fairly and in open daylight.<a
id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
Having then addressed to his officers a few brief encouragements,
which met with enthusiastic response, he dismissed them to their
evening meal and repose.</p>

<p>On the next morning, he marshalled his army, consisting of
40,000 foot, and 7000 horse, in two lines.<a id="FNanchor_379"
href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The first or
main line was composed, on the right, of the eight squadrons of
Companion-cavalry, each with its separate captain, but all under
the command of Philôtas, son of Parmenio. Next (proceeding from
right to left) came the Agêma or chosen band of the Hypaspistæ—then
the remaining Hypaspistæ, under Nikanor—then the phalanx properly
so called, distributed into six divisions, under the command
of Kœnus, Perdikkas, Meleager, Polysperchon, Simmias, and
Kraterus, respectively.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Next on the left of the phalanx, were
ranged the allied Grecian cavalry, Lokrian and Phokian, Phthiot,
Malians, and Peloponnesians; after whom, at the extreme left, came
the Thessalians under Philippus—among the best cavalry in the army,
hardly inferior to the Macedonian Companions. As in the two former
battles, Alexander himself took the command of the right half of the
army, confiding the left to Parmenio.</p>

<p>Behind this main line, was placed a second or body of reserve,
intended to guard against attacks in the flanks and rear, which
the superior numbers of the Persians rendered probable. For this
purpose, Alexander reserved,—on the right, the light cavalry or
Lancers—the Pæonians, under Aretes and Aristo—half the Agrianes,
under Attalus—the Macedonian archers, under Brisson—and the
mercenaries of old service, under Kleander; on the left, various
bodies of Thracian and allied cavalry, under their separate
officers. All these different regiments were held ready to repel
attack either in flank or rear. In front of the main line were some
advanced squadrons of cavalry and light troops—Grecian cavalry, under
Menidas on the right, and under Andromachus on the left—a brigade of
darters under Balakrus, together with Agrianian darters, and some
bow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>men. Lastly,
the Thracian infantry were left to guard the camp and baggage.<a
id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Forewarned by a deserter, Alexander avoided the places where
iron spikes had been planted to damage the Macedonian cavalry.<a
id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> He
himself, at the head of the Royal Squadron, on the extreme right, led
the march obliquely in that direction, keeping his right somewhat
in advance. As he neared the enemy, he saw Darius himself with the
Persian left centre immediately opposed to him—Persian guards,
Indians, Albanians, and Karians. Alexander went on inclining to the
right, and Darius stretching his front towards the left to counteract
this movement, but still greatly outflanking the Macedonians to the
left. Alexander had now got so far to his right, that he was almost
beyond the ground levelled by Darius for the operations of his
chariots in front. To check any farther movement in this direction,
the Baktrian 1000 horse and the Scythians in front of the Persian
left, were ordered to make a circuit and attack the Macedonian right
flank. Alexander detached against them his regiment of cavalry
under Menidas, and the action thus began.<a id="FNanchor_383"
href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The Baktrian horse, perceiving the advance of Menidas, turned from
their circuitous movement to attack him, and at first drove him back
until he was supported by the other advanced detachments—Pæonians
and Grecian cavalry. The Baktrians, defeated in their turn, were
supported by the satrap Bessus with the main body of Baktrians and
Scythians in the left portion of Darius’s line. The action was here
for some time warmly contested, with some loss to the Greeks; who
at length however, by a more compact order against enemies whose
fighting was broken and desultory, succeeded in pushing them out of
their place in the line, and thus making a partial opening in it.<a
id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>While this conflict was still going on, Darius had ordered his
scythed chariots to charge, and his main line to follow them,
calculating on the disorder which he expected that they would
occasion. But the chariots were found of little service. The horses
were terrified, checked, or wounded, by the Macedonian archers<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span> and darters in front;
who even found means to seize the reins, pull down the drivers,
and kill the horses. Of the hundred chariots in Darius’s front,
intended to beat down the Macedonian ranks by simultaneous pressure
along their whole line, many were altogether stopped or disabled;
some turned right round, the horses refusing to face the protended
pikes, or being scared with the noise of pike and shield struck
together; some which reached the Macedonian line, were let through
without mischief by the soldiers opening their ranks; a few only
inflicted wounds or damage.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385"
class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the chariots were thus disposed of, and the Persian
main force laid open as advancing behind them, Alexander gave
orders to the troops of his main line, who had hitherto been
perfectly silent,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386"
class="fnanchor">[386]</a> to raise the war-shout and charge at a
quick pace; at the same time directing Aretes with the Pæonians to
repel the assailants on his right flank. He himself, discontinuing
his slanting movement to the right, turned towards the Persian
line, and dashed, at the head of all the Companion-cavalry, into
that partial opening in it, which had been made by the flank
movement of the Baktrians. Having by this opening got partly within
the line, he pushed straight towards the person of Darius; his
cavalry engaging in the closest hand-combat, and thrusting with
their short pikes at the faces of the Persians. Here, as at<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> the Granikus, the
latter were discomposed by this mode of fighting—accustomed as they
were to rely on the use of missiles, with rapid wheeling of the
horse for renewed attack.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387"
class="fnanchor">[387]</a> They were unable to prevent Alexander and
his cavalry from gaining ground and approaching nearer to Darius;
while at the same time, the Macedonian phalanx in front, with its
compact order and long protended pikes, pressed upon the Persian
line opposed to it. For a short interval, the combat here was close
and obstinate; and it might have been much prolonged—since the best
troops of Darius’s army—Greeks, Karians, Persian guards, regal
kinsmen, etc., were here posted,—had the king’s courage been equal to
that of his soldiers. But here, even worse than at Issus, the flight
of the army began with Darius himself. It had been the recommendation
of Cyrus the younger, in attacking the army of his brother Artaxerxes
at Kunaxa, to aim the main blow at the spot where his brother was in
person—since he well knew that victory there was victory everywhere.
Having already once followed this scheme successfully at Issus,
Alexander repeated it with still more signal success at Arbêla.
Darius, who had long been in fear, from the time when he first beheld
his formidable enemy on the neighboring hills, became still more
alarmed when he saw the scythed chariots prove a failure, and when
the Macedonians, suddenly breaking out from absolute silence into an
universal war-cry, came to close quarters with his troops, pressing
towards and menacing the conspicuous chariot on which he stood.<a
id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
The sight and hearing of this terrific <i>mêlée</i>, combined with the
prestige already attaching to Alexander’s name, completely overthrew
the courage and self-possession of Darius. He caused his chariot
to be turned round, and himself set the example of flight.<a
id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span>From this
moment, the battle, though it had lasted so short a time, was
irreparably lost. The king’s flight, followed of course immediately
by that of the numerous attendants around him, spread dismay among
all his troops, leaving them neither centre of command, nor chief to
fight for. The best soldiers in his army, being those immediately
around him, were under these circumstances the first to give way.
The fierce onset of Alexander with the Companion-cavalry, and
the unremitting pressure of the phalanx in front was obstructed
by little else than a mass of disordered fugitives. During the
same time, Aretes with his Pæonians had defeated the Baktrians
on the right flank,<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390"
class="fnanchor">[390]</a> so that Alexander was free to pursue
the routed main body,—which he did most energetically. The cloud
of dust raised by the dense multitude is said to have been so
thick, that nothing could be clearly seen, nor could the pursuers
distinguish the track taken by Darius himself. Amidst this darkness,
the cries and noises from all sides were only the more impressive;
especially the sound from the whips of the charioteers, pushing
their horses to full speed.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391"
class="fnanchor">[391]</a> It was the dust alone which saved Darius
himself from being overtaken by the pursuing cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span>While
Alexander was thus fully successful on his right and centre, the
scene on his left under Parmenio was different. Mazæus, who commanded
the Persian right, after launching his scythed chariots (which may
possibly have done more damage than those launched on the Persian
left, though we have no direct information about them), followed it
up by vigorously charging the Grecian and Thessalian horse in his
front, and also by sending round a detachment of cavalry to attack
them on their left flank.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Here the battle was obstinately contested,
and success for some time doubtful. Even after the flight of
Darius, Parmenio found himself so much pressed, that he sent a
message to Alexander. Alexander, though full of mortification at
relinquishing the pursuit, checked his troops, and brought them
back to the assistance of his left, by the shortest course across
the field of battle. The two left divisions of the phalanx, under
Simmias and Kraterus, had already stopped short in the pursuit,
on receiving the like message from Parmenio; leaving the other
four divisions to follow the advanced movement of Alexander.<a
id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Hence there arose a gap in the midst of the phalanx, between the
four right divisions, and the two left; into which gap a brigade of
Indian and Persian cavalry darted, galloping through the midst of
the Macedonian line to get into the rear and attack the baggage.<a
id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
At first this movement was successful, the guard was found
unprepared, and the Persian prisoners rose at once to set themselves
free; though Sisygambis, whom these prisoners were above measure
anxious to liberate, refused to accept their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span> aid, either from mistrust of their
force, or gratitude for the good treatment received from Alexander.<a
id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
But while these assailants were engaged in plundering the baggage,
they were attacked in the rear by the troops forming the second
Macedonian line, who though at first taken by surprise, had now had
time to face about and reach the camp. Many of the Persian brigade
were thus slain, the rest got off as they could.<a id="FNanchor_396"
href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Mazæus maintained for a certain time fair equality, on his own
side of the battle, even after the flight of Darius. But when, to
the paralyzing effect of that fact in itself, there was added the
spectacle of its disastrous effects on the left half of the Persian
army, neither he nor his soldiers could persevere with unabated vigor
in a useless combat. The Thessalian and Grecian horse, on the other
hand, animated by the turn of fortune in their favor, pressed their
enemies with redoubled energy and at length drove them to flight; so
that Parmenio was victor, on his own side and with his own forces,
before the succors from Alexander reached him.<a id="FNanchor_397"
href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>In conducting those succors, on his way back from the pursuit,
Alexander traversed the whole field of battle, and thus met face
to face some of the best Persian and Parthian cavalry, who were
among the last to retire. The battle was already lost, and they
were seeking only to escape. As they could not turn back, and had
no chance for their lives except by forcing their way through his
Companion-cavalry, the combat here was desperate and mur<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span>derous; all at close
quarters, cut and thrust with hand weapons on both sides contrary to
the Persian custom. Sixty of the Macedonian cavalry were slain; and a
still greater number, including Hephæstion, Kœnus, and Menidas, were
wounded, and Alexander himself encountered great personal danger. He
is said to have been victorious; yet probably most of these brave
men forced their way through and escaped, though leaving many of
their number on the field.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398"
class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>Having rejoined his left, and ascertained that it was not only
out of danger, but victorious, Alexander resumed his pursuit of the
flying Persians, in which Parmenio now took part.<a id="FNanchor_399"
href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The host of Darius
was only a multitude of disorderly fugitives, horse and foot
mingled together. The greater part of them had taken no share in
the battle. Here, as at Issus, they remained crowded in stationary
and unprofitable masses, ready to catch the contagion of terror
and to swell the number of runaways, so soon as the comparatively
small proportion of real combatants in the front had been beaten.
On recommencing the pursuit, Alexander pushed forward with such
celerity, that numbers of the fugitives were slain or taken,
especially at the passage of the river Lykus;<a id="FNanchor_400"
href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> where he was obliged
to halt for a while, since his men as well as their horses were
exhausted. At midnight, he again pushed forward, with such cavalry
as could follow him, to Arbêla, in hopes of capturing the person of
Darius. In this he was disappointed, though he reached Arbêla the
next day. Darius had merely passed through it, leaving an undefended
town, with his bow, shield, chariot, a large treasure, and rich
equipage, as prey to the victor. Parmenio had also occupied without
resistance the Persian camp near the field of battle, capturing
the baggage, the camels, and the elephants.<a id="FNanchor_401"
href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span>To state
anything like positive numbers of slain or prisoners, is impossible.
According to Arrian, 300,000 Persians were slain, and many more
taken prisoners. Diodorus puts the slain at 90,000, Curtius at
40,000. The Macedonian killed were, according to Arrian, not more
than 100—according to Curtius, 300: Diodorus states the slain
at 500, besides a great number of wounded.<a id="FNanchor_402"
href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> The estimate of
Arrian is obviously too great on one side, and too small on the
other; but whatever may be the numerical truth, it is certain that
the prodigious army of Darius was all either killed, taken, or
dispersed, at the battle of Arbêla. No attempt to form a subsequent
army ever succeeded; we read of nothing stronger than divisions
or detachments. The miscellaneous contingents of this once mighty
empire, such at least among them as survived, dispersed to their
respective homes and could never be again mustered in mass.</p>

<p>The defeat of Arbêla was in fact the death blow of the Persian
empire. It converted Alexander into the Great King, and Darius into
nothing better than a fugitive pretender. Among all the causes of
the defeat—here as at Issus—the most prominent and indisputable was
the cowardice of Darius himself. Under a king deficient not merely
in the virtues of a general, but even in those of a private soldier,
and who nevertheless insisted on commanding in person—nothing
short of ruin could ensue. To those brave Persians whom he dragged
into ruin along with him and who knew the real facts, he must have
appeared as the betrayer of the empire. We shall have to recall
this state of sentiment, when we describe hereafter the conspiracy
formed by the Baktrian satrap Bessus. Nevertheless, even if Darius
had behaved with unimpeachable courage, there is little reason to
believe, that the defeat of Arbêla, much less that of Issus, could
have been converted into a victory. Mere immensity of number, even
with immensity of space, was of no efficacy without skill as well as
bravery in the commander. Three-fourths of the Persian army were mere
spectators, who did nothing, and produced absolutely no effect. The
flank movement against Alexander’s right, instead of being made by
some unemployed division, was so carried into effect, as to distract
the Baktrian troops from their place in the front line, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span> thus to create a fatal
break, of which Alexander availed himself for his own formidable
charge in front. In spite of amplitude of space—the condition wanting
at Issus,—the attacks of the Persians on Alexander’s flanks and rear
were feeble and inefficient. After all, Darius relied mainly upon his
front line of battle, strengthened by the scythed chariots; these
latter being found unprofitable, there remained only the direct
conflict, wherein the strong point of the Macedonians resided.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in so far as we can follow the dispositions of
Alexander, they appear the most signal example recorded in antiquity,
of military genius and sagacious combination. He had really as great
an available force as his enemies, because every company in his army
was turned to account, either in actual combat, or in reserve against
definite and reasonable contingences. All his successes, and this
most of all, were fairly earned by his own genius and indefatigable
effort, combined with the admirable organization of his army. But
his good fortune was no less conspicuous in the unceasing faults
committed by his enemies. Except during the short period of Memnon’s
command, the Persian king exhibited nothing but ignorant rashness
alternating with disgraceful apathy; turning to no account his vast
real power of resistance in detail—keeping back his treasures to
become the booty of the victor—suffering the cities which stoutly
held out to perish unassisted—and committing the whole fate of
the empire on two successive occasions, to that very hazard which
Alexander most desired.</p>

<p>The decisive character of the victory was manifested at
once by the surrender of the two great capitals of the Persian
empire—Babylon and Susa. To Babylon, Alexander marched in person;
to Susa, he sent Philoxenus. As he approached Babylon, the satrap
Mazæus met him with the keys of the city; Bagophanes, collector of
the revenue, decorated the road of march with altars, sacrifices,
and scattered flowers; while the general Babylonian population and
their Chaldæan priests poured forth in crowds with acclamations and
presents. Susa was yielded to Philoxenus with the same readiness,
as Babylon to Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403"
class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The sum of treasure acquired at Babylon
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span> great:
sufficient to furnish a large donative to the troops—600 drachms per
man to the Macedonian cavalry, 500 to the foreign cavalry, 200 to the
Macedonian infantry, and something less to the foreign infantry.<a
id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
But the treasure found and appropriated at Susa was yet greater. It
is stated at 50,000 talents<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405"
class="fnanchor">[405]</a> (= about £11,500,000 sterling), a sum
which we might have deemed incredible, if we did not find it greatly
exceeded by what is subsequently reported about the treasures in
Persepolis. Of this Susian treasure four-fifths are said to have
been in uncoined gold and silver, the remainder in golden Darics<a
id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>;
the untouched accumulations of several preceding kings, who had
husbanded them against a season of unforeseen urgency. A moderate
portion of this immense wealth, employed by Darius three years
earlier to push the operations of his fleet, subsidize able Grecian
Officers, and organize anti-Macedonian resistance—would have
preserved both his life and his crown.</p>

<p>Alexander rested his troops for more than thirty days amidst
the luxurious indulgences of Babylon. He gratified the feelings of
the population and the Chaldæan priests by solemn sacrifices to
Belus, as well as by directing that the temple of that god, and
the other temples destroyed in the preceding century by Xerxes,
should be rebuilt.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407"
class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Treating the Persian empire now as
an established conquest, he nominated the various satraps. He
confirmed the Persian Mazæus in the satrapy of Babylon, but put
along with them two Greeks as assistants and guarantees—Apollodorus
of Amphipolis, as commander of the military force—Asklepiodorus as
collector of the revenue. He rewarded the Persian traitor Mithrines,
who had surrendered at his approach the strong citadel of Sardis,
with the satrapy of Armenia. To that of Syria and Phenicia, he
appointed Menes, who took with him 3000 talents, to be remitted
to Antipater for levying new troops against the Lacedæmonians
in Peloponnesus.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408"
class="fnanchor">[408]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p.
170]</span> The march of Alexander from Babylon to Susa occupied
twenty days; an easy route through a country abundantly supplied.
At Susa he was joined by Amyntas son of Andromenes, with a large
reinforcement of about 15,000 men—Macedonians, Greeks, and Thracians.
There were both cavalry and infantry—and what is not the least
remarkable, fifty Macedonian youths of noble family, soliciting
admission into Alexander’s corps of pages.<a id="FNanchor_409"
href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> The incorporation
of these new-comers into the army afforded him the opportunity for
remodelling on several points the organization of his different
divisions, the smaller as well as the larger.<a id="FNanchor_410"
href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>After some delay at Susa—and after confirming the Persian
Abulites, who had surrendered the city, in his satrapy, yet not
without two Grecian officers as guarantees, one commanding the
military force, the other governor of the citadel—Alexander crossed
the river Eulæus or Pasitigris, and directed his march to the
south-east towards Persis proper, the ancient hearth or primitive
seat from whence the original Persian conquerors had issued.<a
id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
Between Susa and Persis lay a mountainous region occupied by the
Uxii—rude but warlike shepherds, to whom the Great King himself
had always been obliged to pay a tribute<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> whenever he went from Susa to
Persepolis, being unable with his inefficient military organization
to overcome the difficulties of such a pass held by an enemy. The
Uxii now demanded the like tribute from Alexander, who replied by
inviting them to meet him at their pass and receive it. Meanwhile
a new and little frequented mountain track had been made known to
him, over which he conducted in person a detachment of troops so
rapidly and secretly as to surprise the mountaineers in their own
villages. He thus not only opened the usual mountain pass for the
transit of his main army, but so cut to pieces and humiliated the
Uxii, that they were forced to sue for pardon. Alexander was at first
disposed to extirpate or expel them; but at length, at the request
of the captive Sisygambis, permitted them to remain as subjects of
the satrap of Susa, imposing a tribute of sheep, horses, and cattle,
the only payment which their poverty allowed.<a id="FNanchor_412"
href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>But bad as the Uxian pass had been, there remained another still
worse—called the Susian or Persian gates,<a id="FNanchor_413"
href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> in the mountains
which surrounded the plain of Persepolis, the centre of Persis
proper. Ariobarzanes, satrap of the province, held this pass; a
narrow defile walled across, with mountain positions on both sides,
from whence the defenders, while out of reach themselves, could
shower down missiles upon an approaching enemy. After four days of
march, Alexander reached on the fifth day the Susian Gates; which,
inexpugnable as they seemed, he attacked on the ensuing morning. In
spite of all the courage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p.
172]</span> his soldiers, however, he sustained loss without damaging
his enemy, and was obliged to return to his camp. He was informed
that there was no other track by which this difficult pass could be
turned; but there was a long circuitous march of many days whereby
it might be evaded, and another entrance found into the plain of
Persepolis. To recede from any enterprise as impracticable, was
a humiliation which Alexander had never yet endured. On farther
inquiry, a Lykian captive, who had been for many years tending sheep
as a slave on the mountains, acquainted him with the existence
of a track known only to himself, whereby he might come on the
flank of Ariobarzanes. Leaving Kraterus in command of the camp,
with orders to attack the pass in front, when he should hear the
trumpet give signal—Alexander marched forth at night at the head
of a light detachment, under the guidance of the Lykian. He had to
surmount incredible hardship and difficulty—the more so as it was
mid-winter, and the mountain was covered with snow; yet such were
the efforts of his soldiers and the rapidity of his movements, that
he surprised all the Persian outposts, and came upon Ariobarzanes
altogether unprepared. Attacked as they were at the same time by
Kraterus also, the troops of the satrap were forced to abandon the
Gates, and were for the most part cut to pieces. Many perished in
their flight among the rocks and precipices; the satrap himself being
one of a few that escaped.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414"
class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Though the citadel of Persepolis is described as one of the
strongest of fortresses,<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415"
class="fnanchor">[415]</a> yet after this unexpected conquest of
a pass hitherto deemed inexpugnable, few had courage to think of
holding it against Alexander. Nevertheless Ariobarzanes, hastening
thither from the conquered pass, still strove to organize a defence,
and at least to carry off the regal treasure, which some in the
town were already preparing to pillage. But Tiridates, commander of
the garrison, fearing the wrath of the conqueror, resisted this,
and despatched a message entreating Alexander to hasten his march.
Accordingly Alexander, at the head of his cavalry, set forth with
the utmost speed, and arrived in time to detain and appropriate
the whole. Ariobarzanes, in a vain at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span>tempt to resist, was slain with all his
companions. Persepolis and Pasargadæ—the two peculiar capitals of
the Persian race, the latter memorable as containing the sepulchre
of Cyrus the Great—both fell into the hands of the conqueror.<a
id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>On approaching Persepolis, the compassion of the army was
powerfully moved by the sight of about 800 Grecian captives, all of
them mutilated in some frightful and distressing way, by loss of
legs, arms, eyes, ears, or some other bodily members. Mutilation
was a punishment commonly inflicted in that age by Oriental
governors, even by such as were not accounted cruel. Thus Xenophon,
in eulogizing the rigid justice of Cyrus the younger, remarks
that in the public roads of his satrapy, men were often seen who
had been deprived of their arms or legs, or otherwise mutilated,
by penal authority.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417"
class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Many of these maimed captives at
Persepolis were old, and had lived for years in their unfortunate
condition. They had been brought up from various Greek cities by
order of some of the preceding Persian kings; but on what pretences
they had been thus cruelly dealt with, we are not informed.
Alexander, moved to tears at such a spectacle, offered to restore
them to their respective homes, with a comfortable provision for
the future. But most of them felt so ashamed of returning to their
homes, that they entreated to be allowed to remain all together in
Persis, with lands assigned to them, and with dependent cultivators
to raise produce for them. Alexander granted their request in the
fullest measure, conferring besides upon each an ample donation of
money, clothing, and cattle.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418"
class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span>The sight
of these mutilated Greeks was well calculated to excite not merely
sympathy for them, but rage against the Persians, in the bosoms
of all spectators. Alexander seized this opportunity, as well for
satiating the anger and cupidity of his soldiers, as for manifesting
himself in his self-assumed character of avenger of Greece against
the Persians, to punish the wrongs done by Xerxes a century and a
half before. He was now amidst the native tribes and seats of the
Persians, the descendants of those rude warriors who, under the first
Cyrus, had overspread Western Asia from the Indus to the Ægean. In
this their home the Persian kings had accumulated their national
edifices, their regal sepulchres, the inscriptions commemorative
of their religious or legendary sentiment, with many trophies and
acquisitions arising out of their conquests. For the purposes of the
Great King’s empire, Babylon, or Susa, or Ekbatana, were more central
and convenient residences; but Persepolis was still regarded as the
heart of Persian nationality. It was the chief magazine, though
not the only one, of those annual accumulations from the imperial
revenue, which each king successively increased, and which none
seems to have ever diminished. Moreover, the Persian grandees and
officers, who held the lucrative satrapies and posts of the empire,
were continually sending wealth home to Persis, for themselves or
their relatives.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span>
We may therefore reasonably believe what we find asserted, that
Persepolis possessed at this time more wealth, public and private,
than any place within the range of Grecian or Macedonian knowledge.<a
id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>Convening his principal officers, Alexander denounced
Persepolis as the most hostile of all Asiatic cities,—the home
of those impious invaders of Greece, whom he had come to attack.
He proclaimed his intention of abandoning it to be plundered, as
well as of burning the citadel. In this resolution he persisted,
notwithstanding the remonstrance of Parmenio, who reminded him
that the act would be a mere injury to himself by ruining his own
property, and that the Asiatics would construe it as evidence of
an intention to retire speedily, without founding any permanent
dominion in the country.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420"
class="fnanchor">[420]</a> After appropriating the regal treasure—to
the alleged amount of 120,000 talents in gold and silver =
£27,600,000 sterling<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421"
class="fnanchor">[421]</a>—Alexander set fire<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> to the citadel. A host of mules, with
5000 camels, were sent for from Mesopotamia and elsewhere, to carry
off this prodigious treasure; the whole of which was conveyed out of
Persis proper, partly to be taken along with Alexander himself in
his ulterior marches, partly to be lodged in Susa and Ekbatana. Six
thousand talents more, found in Pasargadæ, were added to the spoil.<a
id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
The persons and property of the inhabitants were abandoned to
the license of the soldiers, who obtained an immense booty,
not merely in gold and silver, but also in rich clothing,
furniture, and ostentatious ornaments of every kind. The male
inhabitants were slain,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423"
class="fnanchor">[423]</a> the females dragged into servitude;
except such as obtained safety by flight, or burned themselves with
their property in their own houses. Among the soldiers themselves,
much angry scrambling took place for the possession of precious
articles, not without occasional bloodshed.<a id="FNanchor_424"
href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> As soon as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span> their ferocity and
cupidity had been satiated, Alexander arrested the massacre. His
encouragement and sanction of it was not a burst of transient fury,
provoked by unexpected length of resistance, such as the hanging of
the 2000 Tyrians and the dragging of Batis at Gaza—but a deliberate
proceeding, intended partly as a recompense and gratification
to the soldiery, but still more as an imposing manifestation of
retributive vengeance against the descendants of the ancient Persian
invaders. In his own letters seen by Plutarch, Alexander described
the massacre of the native Persians as having been ordered by him on
grounds of state policy.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425"
class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>As it was now winter or very early spring, he suffered his main
army to enjoy a month or more of repose at or near Persepolis. But
he himself, at the head of a rapidly moving division, traversed
the interior of Persia proper; conquering or receiving into
submission the various towns and villages.<a id="FNanchor_426"
href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The greatest
resistance which he experienced was offered by the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span> rude and warlike
tribe called the Mardi; but worse than any enemy was the severity
of the season and the rugged destitution of a frozen country.
Neither physical difficulties, however, nor human enemies, could
arrest the march of Alexander. He returned from his expedition,
complete master of Persis; and in the spring, quitted that province
with his whole army, to follow Darius into Media. He left only a
garrison of 3000 Macedonians at Persepolis, preserving to Tiridates,
who had surrendered to him the place, the title of satrap.<a
id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Darius was now a fugitive, with the mere title of king, and
with a simple body-guard rather than an army. On leaving Arbêla
after the defeat, he had struck in an easterly direction across
the mountains into Media; having only a few attendants round him,
and thinking himself too happy to preserve his own life from an
indefatigable pursuer.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428"
class="fnanchor">[428]</a> He calculated that, once across these
mountains, Alexander would leave him for a time unmolested, in haste
to march southward for the purpose of appropriating the great and
real prizes of the campaign—Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis. The last
struggles of this ill-starred prince will be recounted in another
chapter.</p>

    MILITARY OPERATIONS AND CONQUESTS OF ALEXANDER, AFTER
    HIS WINTER-QUARTERS IN PERSIS, DOWN TO HIS DEATH
    AT&nbsp;BABYLON.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">From</span> this time forward
to the close of Alexander’s life—a period of about seven years—his
time was spent in conquering the eastern half of the Persian empire,
together with various independent tribes lying beyond its extreme
boundary. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span>
neither Greece, nor Asia Minor, nor any of his previous western
acquisitions, was he ever destined to see again.</p>

<p>Now, in regard to the history of Greece—the subject of these
volumes—the first portion of Alexander’s Asiatic campaigns (from his
crossing the Hellespont to the conquest of Persis, a period of four
years, March 334 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, to March 330
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), though not of direct bearing,
is yet of material importance. Having in his first year completed
the subjugation of the Hellenic world, he had by these subsequent
campaigns absorbed it as a small fraction into the vast Persian
empire, renovated under his imperial sceptre. He had accomplished a
result substantially the same as would have been brought about if the
invasion of Greece by Xerxes, destined, a century and a half before,
to incorporate Greece with the Persian monarchy, had succeeded
instead of failing.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429"
class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Towards the kings of Macedonia alone,
the subjugation of Greece would never have become complete, so long
as she could receive help from the native Persian kings, who were
perfectly adequate as a countervailing and tutelary force, had they
known how to play their game. But all hope for Greece from without
was extinguished, when Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis became subject
to the same ruler as Pella and Amphipolis—and that ruler too, the
ablest general, and most insatiate aggressor, of his age; to whose
name was attached the prestige of success almost superhuman. Still,
against even this overwhelming power, some of the bravest of the
Greeks at home tried to achieve their liberation with the sword: we
shall see presently how sadly the attempt miscarried.</p>

<p>But though the first four years of Alexander’s Asiatic expedition,
in which he conquered the Western half of the Persian empire, had
thus an important effect on the condition and destinies of the
Grecian cities—his last seven years, on which we are now about to
enter, employed chiefly in conquering the Eastern half, scarcely
touched these cities in any way. The stupendous marches to the
rivers Jaxartes, Indus, and Hyphasis, which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span> carried his victorious arms over so
wide a space of Central Asia, not only added nothing to his power
over the Greeks, but even withdrew him from all dealings with them,
and placed him almost beyond their cognizance. To the historian of
Greece, therefore, these latter campaigns can hardly be regarded as
included within the range of his subject. They deserve to be told,
as examples of military skill and energy, and as illustrating the
character of the most illustrious general of antiquity—one who,
though not a Greek, had become the master of all Greeks. But I shall
not think it necessary to recount them in any detail, like the
battles of Issus and Arbêla.</p>

<p>About six or seven months had elapsed from the battle of
Arbêla to the time when Alexander prepared to quit his most
recent conquest—Persis proper. During all this time, Darius had
remained at Ekbatana,<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430"
class="fnanchor">[430]</a> the chief city of Media, clinging to the
hope, that Alexander, when possessed of the three southern capitals
and the best part of the Persian empire, might have reached the point
of satiation, and might leave him unmolested in the more barren
East. As soon as he learnt that Alexander was in movement towards
him, he sent forward his harem and his baggage to Hyrkania, on the
south-eastern border of the Caspian sea. Himself, with the small
force around him, followed in the same direction, carrying off the
treasure in the city (7000 talents= £1,610,000 in amount), and passed
through the Caspian Grates into the territory of Parthyênê. His only
chance was to escape to Baktria at the eastern extremity of the
empire, ruining the country in his way for the purpose of retarding
pur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span>suers.
But this chance diminished every day, from desertion among his
few followers, and angry disgust among many who remained.<a
id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Eight days after Darius had quitted Ekbatana, Alexander entered
it. How many days had been occupied in his march from Persepolis, we
cannot say: in itself a long march, it had been farther prolonged,
partly by the necessity of subduing the intervening mountaineers
called Parætakeni,<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432"
class="fnanchor">[432]</a> partly by rumors exaggerating the Persian
force at Ekbatana, and inducing him to advance with precaution and
regular array. Possessed of Ekbatana—the last capital stronghold
of the Persian kings, and their ordinary residence during the
summer months—he halted to rest his troops, and establish a new
base of operations for his future proceedings eastward. He made
Ekbatana his principal depôt; depositing in the citadel, under the
care of Harpalus as treasurer, with a garrison of 6000 or 7000
Macedonians, the accumulated treasures of his past conquests, out
of Susa and Persepolis; amounting, we are told, to the enormous
sum of 180,000 talents = £41,400,000 sterling.<a id="FNanchor_433"
href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> Parmenio was
invested with the chief command of this important post, and of the
military force left in Media; of which territory Oxodates, a Persian
who had been imprisoned at Susa by Darius, was named satrap.<a
id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>At Ekbatana Alexander was joined by a fresh force of 6000
Grecian mercenaries,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435"
class="fnanchor">[435]</a> who had marched from Kilikia into the
interior, probably crossing the Euphrates and Tigris at the same
points as Alexander himself had crossed. Hence he was enabled the
better to dismiss his Thessalian cavalry, with other Greeks who
had been serving during his four years of Asiatic war, and who
now wished to go home.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436"
class="fnanchor">[436]</a> He distributed among them the sum of 2000
talents in addition to their full pay, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span> gave them the price of their horses,
which they sold before departure. The operations which he was now
about to commence against the eastern territories of Persia were
not against regular armies, but against flying corps and distinct
native tribes, relying for defence chiefly on the difficulties
which mountains, deserts, privation, or mere distance, would
throw in the way of an assailant. For these purposes he required
an increased number of light troops, and was obliged to impose
even upon his heavy-armed cavalry the most rapid and fatiguing
marches, such as none but his Macedonian Companions would have
been contented to execute; moreover he was called upon to act less
with large masses, and more with small and broken divisions. He
now therefore for the first time established a regular Taxis, or
division of horse-bowmen.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437"
class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>Remaining at Ekbatana no longer than was sufficient for
these new arrangements, Alexander recommenced his pursuit of
Darius. He hoped to get before Darius to the Caspian Gates,
at the north-eastern extremity of Media; by which Gates<a
id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
was un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span>derstood
a mountain-pass, or rather a road of many hours’ march, including
several difficult passes stretching eastward along the southern
side of the great range of Taurus towards Parthia. He marched with
his Companion-cavalry, the light-horse, the Agrianians, and the
bowmen—the greater part of the phalanx keeping up as well as it
could—to Rhagæ, about fifty miles north of the Caspian Gates; which
town he reached in eleven days, by exertions so severe that many men
as well as horses were disabled on the road. But in spite of all
speed, he learnt that Darius had already passed through the Caspian
Gates. After five days of halt at Rhagæ, indispensable for his army,
Alexander passed them also. A day’s march on the other side of them,
he was joined by two eminent Persians, Bagistanes and Antibêlus,
who informed him that Darius was already dethroned and in imminent
danger of losing his life.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439"
class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>The conspirators by whom this had been done, were Bessus, satrap
of Baktria—Barsaentes, satrap of Drangiana and Arachosia—and
Nabarzanes, general of the regal guards. The small force of Darius
having been thinned by daily desertion, most of those who remained
were the contingents of the still unconquered territories, Baktria,
Arachosia, and Drangiana, under the orders of their respective
satraps. The Grecian mercenaries, 1500 in number, and Artabazus,
with a band under his special command, adhered inflexibly to
Darius, but the soldiers of Eastern Asia followed their own
satraps. Bessus and his colleagues intended to make their peace
with Alexander by surrendering Darius, should Alexander pursue so
vigorously as to leave them no hope of escape; but if they could
obtain time to reach Baktria and Sogdiana, they resolved to organize
an energetic resistance, under their own joint command, for the
defence of those eastern provinces—the most warlike population of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> empire.<a
id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
Under the desperate circumstances of the case, this plan was perhaps
the least unpromising that could be proposed. The chance of resisting
Alexander, small as it was at the best, became absolutely nothing
under the command of Darius, who had twice set the example of flight
from the field of battle, betraying both his friends and his empire,
even when surrounded by the full force of Persia. For brave and
energetic Persians, unless they were prepared at once to submit to
the invader, there was no choice but to set aside Darius; nor does
it appear that the conspirators intended at first anything worse.
At a village called Thara in Parthia, they bound him in chains of
gold—placed him in a covered chariot surrounded by the Baktrian
troops,—and thus carried him onward, retreating as fast as they
could; Bessus assuming the command. Artabazus, with the Grecian
mercenaries, too feeble to prevent the proceeding, quitted the army
in disgust, and sought refuge among the mountains of the Tapuri
bordering on Hyrkania towards the Caspian Sea.<a id="FNanchor_441"
href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>On hearing this intelligence, Alexander strained every nerve to
overtake the fugitives and get possession of the person of Darius.
At the head of his Companion-cavalry, his light-horse, and a body of
infantry picked out for their strength and activity, he put himself
in instant march, with nothing but arms and two days’ provisions
for each man; leaving Kraterus to bring on the main body by easier
journeys. A forced march of two nights and one day, interrupted only
by a short midday repose (it was now the month of July), brought him
at daybreak to the Persian camp which his informant Bagistanes had
quitted. But Bessus and his troops were already beyond it, having
made considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>
advance in their flight; upon which Alexander, notwithstanding the
exhaustion both of men and horses, pushed on with increased speed
through all the night to the ensuing day at noon. He there found
himself in the village where Bessus had encamped on the preceding
day. Yet learning from deserters that his enemies had resolved to
hasten their retreat by night marches, he despaired of overtaking
them, unless he could find some shorter road. He was informed that
there was another shorter, but leading through a waterless desert.
Setting out by this road late in the day with his cavalry, he got
over no less than forty-five miles during the night, so as to come on
Bessus by complete surprise on the following morning. The Persians,
marching in disorder without arms, and having no expectation of
an enemy, were so panic-struck at the sudden appearance of their
indefatigable conqueror, that they dispersed and fled without any
attempt to resist. In this critical moment, Bessus and Barsaentes
urged Darius to leave his chariot, mount his horse, and accompany
them in their flight. But he refused to comply. They were determined
however that he should not fall alive into the hands of Alexander,
whereby his name would have been employed against them, and would
have materially lessened their chance of defending the eastern
provinces; they were moreover incensed by his refusal, and had
contracted a feeling of hatred and contempt to which they were
glad to give effect. Casting their javelins at him, they left him
mortally wounded, and then pursued their flight.<a id="FNanchor_442"
href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> His chariot, not
distinguished by any visible mark, nor known even to the Persian
soldiers themselves, was for some time not detected by the pursuers.
At length a Macedonian soldier named Polystratus found him expiring,
and is said to have received his last words; wherein he expressed
thanks to Alexander for the kind treatment of his captive female
relatives, and satisfaction that the Persian throne, lost to
himself, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span>
about to pass to so generous a conqueror. It is at least certain
that he never lived to see Alexander himself.<a id="FNanchor_443"
href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>Alexander had made the prodigious and indefatigable marches of
the last four days, not without destruction to many men and horses,
for the express purpose of taking Darius alive. It would have been a
gratification to his vanity to exhibit the Great King as a helpless
captive, rescued from his own servants by the sword of his enemy, and
spared to occupy some subordinate command as a token of ostentatious
indulgence. Moreover, apart from such feelings, it would have been a
point of real advantage to seize the person of Darius, by means of
whose name Alexander would have been enabled to stifle all farther
resistance in the extensive and imperfectly known regions eastward of
the Caspian Gates. The satraps of these regions had now gone thither
with their hands free, to kindle as much Asiatic sentiment and levy
as large a force as they could, against the Macedonian conqueror; who
was obliged to follow them, if he wished to complete the subjugation
of the empire. We can understand therefore that Alexander was deeply
mortified in deriving no result from this ruinously fatiguing march,
and can the better explain that savage wrath which we shall hereafter
find him manifesting against the satrap Bessus.</p>

<p>Alexander caused the body of Darius to be buried with full
pomp and ceremonial, in the regal sepulchres of Persis. The last
days of this unfortunate prince have been described with almost
tragic pathos by historians; and there are few subjects in history
better calculated to excite such a feeling, if we regard simply the
magnitude of his fall, from the highest pitch of power and splendor
to defeat, degradation, and assassination. But an impartial review
will not allow us to forget that the main cause of such ruin was
his own blindness—his long apathy after the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span> battle of Issus, and abandonment
of Tyre and Gaza, in the fond hope of repurchasing queens whom
he had himself exposed to captivity—lastly, what is still less
pardonable, his personal cowardice in both the two decisive battles
deliberately brought about by himself. If we follow his conduct
throughout the struggle, we shall find little of that which renders
a defeated prince either respectable or interesting. Those who had
the greatest reason to denounce and despise him were his friends
and his countrymen, whom he possessed ample means of defending, yet
threw those means away. On the other hand, no one had better grounds
for indulgence towards him than his conqueror; for whom he had
kept unused the countless treasures of the three capitals, and for
whom he had lightened in every way the difficulties of a conquest,
in itself hardly less than impracticable.<a id="FNanchor_444"
href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>The recent forced march, undertaken by Alexander for the purpose
of securing Darius as a captive, had been distressing in the extreme
to his soldiers, who required a certain period of repose and
compensation. This was granted to them at the town of Hekatompylus
in Parthia, where the whole army was again united. Besides abundant
supplies from the neighboring region, the soldiers here received a
donative derived from the large booty taken in the camp of Darius.<a
id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> In
the enjoyment and revelry universal throughout the army, Alexander
himself partook. His indulgences in the banquet and in wine-drinking,
to which he was always addicted when leisure allowed were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> now unusually
multiplied and prolonged. Public solemnities were celebrated,
together with theatrical exhibitions by artists who joined the army
from Greece. But the change of most importance in Alexander’s conduct
was, that he now began to feel and act manifestly as successor of
Darius on the Persian throne; to disdain the comparative simplicity
of Macedonian habits, and to assume the pomp, the ostentatious
apparatus of luxuries, and even the dress, of a Persian king.</p>

<p>To many of Alexander’s soldiers, the conquest of Persia appeared
to be consummated and the war finished, by the death of Darius.
They were reluctant to exchange the repose and enjoyments of
Hekatompylus for fresh fatigues; but Alexander, assembling the
select regiments, addressed to them an emphatic appeal which
revived the ardor of all.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446"
class="fnanchor">[446]</a> His first march was, across one of the
passes from the south to the north of Mount Elburz, into Hyrkania,
the region bordering the south-eastern corner of the Caspian Sea.
Here he found no resistance; the Hyrkanian satrap Phrataphernes,
together with Nabarzanes, Artabazus, and other eminent Persians,
surrendered themselves to him, and were favorably received. The
Greek mercenaries, 1500 in number, who had served with Darius, but
had retired when that monarch was placed under arrest by Bessus,
sent envoys requesting to be allowed to surrender on capitulation.
But Alexander—reproaching them with guilt for having taken service
with the Persians, in contravention of the vote passed by the
Hellenic synod—required them to surrender at discretion; which they
expressed their readiness to do, praying that an officer might be
despatched to conduct them to him in safety.<a id="FNanchor_447"
href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The Macedonian
Andronikus was sent for this purpose, while Alexander undertook
an expedition into the mountains of the Mardi; a name seemingly
borne by several distinct tribes in parts remote from each other,
but all poor and brave mountaineers. These Mardi occupied parts of
the northern slope of the range of Mount Elburz a few miles from
the Caspian Sea (Mazanderan and Ghilan). Alexander pursued them
into all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span> their
retreats,—overcame them, when they stood on their defence, with
great slaughter,—and reduced the remnant of the half-destroyed
tribes to sue for peace.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448"
class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<p>From this march, which had carried him in a westerly direction,
he returned to Hyrkania. At the first halt he was met by the
Grecian mercenaries who came to surrender themselves, as well as by
various Grecian envoys from Sparta, Chalkedon, and Sinôpe, who had
accompanied Darius in his flight. Alexander put the Lacedæmonians
under arrest, but liberated the other envoys, considering Chalkedon
and Sinôpe to have been subjects of Darius, not members of the
Hellenic synod. As to the mercenaries, he made a distinction between
those who had enlisted in the Persian service before the recognition
of Philip as leader of Greece—and those whose enlistment had been
of later date. The former he liberated at once; the latter he
required to remain in his service under the command of Andronikus,
on the same pay as they had hitherto received.<a id="FNanchor_449"
href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Such was the untoward
conclusion of Grecian mercenary service with Persia; a system whereby
the Persian monarchs, had they known how to employ it with tolerable
ability, might well have maintained their empire even against such
an enemy as Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450"
class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>After fifteen days of repose and festivity at Zeudracarta, the
chief town of Hyrkania, Alexander marched eastward with his united
army through Parthia into Aria—the region adjoining the modern Herat
with its river now known as Herirood. Satibarzanes, the satrap
of Aria, came to him near the border, to a town named Susia,<a
id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
submitted, and was allowed to retain his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span> satrapy; while Alexander, merely
skirting the northern border of Aria, marched in a direction nearly
east towards Baktria against the satrap Bessus, who was reported as
having proclaimed himself King of Persia. But it was discovered,
after three or four days, that Satibarzanes was in league with
Bessus; upon which Alexander suspended for the present his plans
against Baktria, and turned by forced marches to Artakoana, the
chief city of Aria.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452"
class="fnanchor">[452]</a> His return was so unexpectedly rapid,
that the Arians were overawed, and Satibarzanes was obliged to
escape. A few days enabled him to crush the disaffected Arians and
to await the arrival of his rear division under Kraterus. He then
marched southward into the territory of the Drangi, or Drangiana (the
modern Seiestan), where he found no resistance—the satrap Barsaentes
having sought safety among some of the Indians.<a id="FNanchor_453"
href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>In the chief town of Drangiana occurred the revolting tragedy,
of which Philotas was the first victim, and his father Parmenio the
second. Parmenio, now seventy years of age, and therefore little
qualified for the fatigue inseparable from the invasion of the
eastern satrapies, had been left in the important post of com<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span>manding the great
depôt and treasure at Ekbatana. His long military experience, and
confidential position even under Philip, rendered him the second
person in the Macedonian army, next to Alexander himself. His three
sons were all soldiers. The youngest of them, Hektor, had been
accidentally drowned in the Nile, while in the suite of Alexander
in Egypt; the second, Nikanor, had commanded the hypaspists or
light infantry, but had died of illness, fortunately for himself,
a short time before;<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454"
class="fnanchor">[454]</a> the eldest, Philotas, occupied the high
rank of general of the Companion-cavalry, in daily communication with
Alexander, from whom he received personal orders.</p>

<p>A revelation came to Philotas, from Kebalinus, brother of a
youth named Nikomachus, that a soldier, named Dimnus of Chalastra,
had made boast to Nikomachus, his intimate friend or beloved
person, under vows of secrecy, of an intended conspiracy against
Alexander, inviting him to become an accomplice.<a id="FNanchor_455"
href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Nikomachus, at
first struck with abhorrence, at length simulated compliance, asked
who were the accomplices of Dimnus, and received intimation of a
few names; all of which he presently communicated to his brother
Kebalinus, for the purpose of being divulged. Kebalinus told the
facts to Philotas, entreating him to mention them to Alexander. But
Philotas, though every day in communication with the king, neglected
to do this for two days; upon which Kebalinus began to suspect him
of connivance, and caused the revelation to be made to Alexander
through one of the pages named Metron. Dimnus was immediately
arrested, but ran himself through with his sword, and expired without
making any declaration.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456"
class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p>Of this conspiracy, real or pretended, every thing rested on the
testimony of Nikomachus. Alexander indignantly sent for Philotas,
demanding why he had omitted for two days to communicate what
he had heard. Philotas replied, that the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> source from which it came was too
contemptible to deserve notice—that it would have been ridiculous
to attach importance to the simple declarations of such a youth as
Nikomachus, recounting the foolish boasts addressed to him by a
lover. Alexander received, or affected to receive, the explanation,
gave his hand to Philotas, invited him to supper, and talked to him
with his usual familiarity.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457"
class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>But it soon appeared that advantage was to be taken of this
incident for the disgrace and ruin of Philotas, whose free-spoken
criticisms on the pretended divine paternity,—-coupled with boasts,
that he and his father Parmenio had been chief agents in the
conquest of Asia,—had neither been forgotten nor forgiven. These,
and other self-praises, disparaging to the glory of Alexander,
had been divulged by a mistress to whom Philotas was attached; a
beautiful Macedonian woman of Pydna, named Antigonê, who, having
first been made a prize in visiting Samothrace by the Persian
admiral Autophradates, was afterwards taken amidst the spoils of
Damascus by the Macedonians victorious at Issus. The reports of
Antigonê, respecting some unguarded language held by Philotas to
her, had come to the knowledge of Kraterus, who brought her to
Alexander, and caused her to repeat them to him. Alexander desired
her to take secret note of the confidential expressions of Philotas,
and report them from time to time to himself.<a id="FNanchor_458"
href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>It thus turned out that Alexander, though continuing to Philotas
his high military rank, and talking to him constantly with seeming
confidence, had for at least eighteen months, ever since his
conquest of Egypt and perhaps even earlier, disliked and suspected
him, keeping him under perpetual watch through the suborned and
secret communications of a treacherous mistress.<a id="FNanchor_459"
href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> Some of the generals
around Alexander—especially Kraterus, the first suborner of
Antigonê—fomented these suspicions, from jealousy of the great
ascendency of Parmenio and his family. Moreover, Philotas himself was
ostentatious and overbearing in his demeanor, so as to have made many
enemies among the soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460"
class="fnanchor">[460]</a> But whatever may have been his defects
on this head—defects which he shared with the other Macedonian
generals, all gorged with plunder and presents<a id="FNanchor_461"
href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>—his fidelity as well
as his military merits stand attested by the fact that Alexander had
continued to employ him in the highest and most confidential command
throughout all the long subsequent interval; and that Parmenio was
now general at Ekbatana, the most important military appointment
which the king had to confer. Even granting the deposition of
Nikomachus to be trustworthy, there was nothing to implicate
Philotas, whose name had not been included among the accomplices said
to have been enumerated by Dimnus. There was not a tittle of evidence
against him, except the fact that the deposition had been made known
to him, and that he had seen Alexander twice without communicating
it. Upon this single fact, however, Kraterus, and the other enemies
of Philotas, worked so effectually as to inflame the suspicions
and the pre-existing ill-will of Alexander into fierce rancor. He
resolved on the disgrace, torture, and death of Philotas,—and on the
death of Parmenio besides.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462"
class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>To accomplish this, however, against the two highest officers
in the Macedonian service, one of them enjoying a separate and
distant command—required management. Alexander was obliged to
carry the feelings of the soldiers along with him, and to obtain
a condemnation from the army; according to an ancient Macedonian
custom, in regard to capital crimes, though<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> (as it seems) not uniformly practised.
Alexander not only kept the resolution secret, but is even said to
have invited Philotas to supper with the other officers, conversing
with him just as usual.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463"
class="fnanchor">[463]</a> In the middle of the night, Philotas
was arrested while asleep in his bed,—put in chains,—and clothed
in an ignoble garb. A military assembly was convened at daybreak,
before which Alexander appeared with the chief officers in his
confidence. Addressing the soldiers in a vehement tone of mingled
sorrow and anger, he proclaimed to them that his life had just
been providentially rescued from a dangerous conspiracy organized
by two men hitherto trusted as his best friends—Philotas and
Parmenio—through the intended agency of a soldier named Dimnus,
who had slain himself when arrested. The dead body of Dimnus was
then exhibited to the meeting, while Nikomachus and Kebalinus
were brought forward to tell their story. A letter from Parmenio
to his sons Philotas and Nikanor, found among the papers seized
on the arrest, was read to the meeting. Its terms were altogether
vague and unmeaning; but Alexander chose to construe them as it
suited his purpose.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464"
class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>We may easily conceive the impression produced upon these
assembled soldiers by such denunciations from Alexander
himself—revelations of his own personal danger, and reproaches
against treacherous friends. Amyntas, and even Kœnus, the
brother-in-law of Philotas, were yet more unmeasured in
their invectives against the accused.<a id="FNanchor_465"
href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> They, as well as
the other officers with whom the arrest had been concerted, set the
example of violent manifestation against him, and ardent sympathy
with the king’s danger. Philotas was heard in his defence, which
though strenuously denying the charge, is said to have been feeble.
It was indeed sure to be so, coming from one seized thus suddenly,
and overwhelmed with disadvantages; while a degree of courage,
absolutely heroic, would have been required<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> for any one else to rise and presume to
criticise the proofs. A soldier named Bolon harangued his comrades on
the insupportable insolence of Philotas, who always (he said) treated
the soldiers with contempt, turning them out of their quarters to
make room for his countless retinue of slaves. Though this allegation
(probably enough well-founded) was no way connected with the charge
of treason against the king, it harmonized fully with the temper of
the assembly, and wound them up to the last pitch of fury. The royal
pages began the cry, echoed by all around, that they would with
their own hands tear the parricide in pieces.<a id="FNanchor_466"
href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>It would have been fortunate for Philotas if their wrath had
been sufficiently ungovernable to instigate the execution of
such a sentence on the spot. But this did not suit the purpose
of his enemies. Aware that he had been condemned upon the regal
word, with nothing better than the faintest negative ground of
suspicion, they determined to extort from him a confession such
as would justify their own purposes, not only against him, but
against his father Parmenio—whom there was as yet nothing to
implicate. Accordingly, during the ensuing night, Philotas was
put to the torture. Hephæstion, Kraterus, and Kœnus—the last of
the three being brother-in-law of Philotas<a id="FNanchor_467"
href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>—themselves
superintended the ministers of physical suffering. Alexander
himself too was at hand, but concealed by a curtain. It is said
that Philotas manifested little firmness under torture, and that
Alexander, an unseen witness, indulged in sneers against the
cowardice of one who had fought by his side in so many battles.<a
id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
All who stood by were enemies, and likely to describe the conduct
of Philotas in such manner as to justify their own hatred. The
tortures inflicted,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469"
class="fnanchor">[469]</a> cruel in the extreme and long<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span>-continued, wrung from
him at last a confession, implicating his father along with himself.
He was put to death; and at the same time, all those whose names had
been indicated by Nikomachus, were slain also—apparently by being
stoned, without preliminary torture. Philotas had serving in the
army a numerous kindred, all of whom were struck with consternation
at the news of his being tortured. It was the Macedonian law that
all kinsmen of a man guilty of treason were doomed to death along
with him. Accordingly, some of these men slew themselves, others
fled from the camp, seeking refuge wherever they could. Such was
the terror and tumult in the camp, that Alexander was obliged to
proclaim a suspension of this sanguinary law for the occasion.<a
id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>It now remained to kill Parmenio, who could not be safely left
alive after the atrocities used towards Philotas; and to kill him,
moreover, before he could have time to hear of them, since he was
not only the oldest, most respected, and most influential of all
Macedonian officers, but also in separate command of the great
depôt at Ekbatana. Alexander summoned to his presence one of the
Companions named Polydamas; a particular friend, comrade, or <i>aide
de camp</i>, of Parmenio. Every friend of Philotas felt at this moment
that his life hung by a thread; so that Polydamas entered the
king’s presence in extreme terror, the rather as he was ordered to
bring with him his two younger brothers. Alexander addressed him,
denouncing Parmenio as a traitor, and intimating that Polydamas would
be required to carry a swift and confidential message to Ekbatana,
ordering his execution. Polydamas was selected as the attached friend
of Parmenio, and therefore as best calculated to deceive him. Two
letters were placed in his hands, addressed to Parmenio; one from
Alexander himself, conveying ostensibly military communications
and orders; the other, signed with the seal-ring of the deceased
Philotas, and purporting to be addressed by the son to the father.
Together with these, Polydamas received the real and important
despatch, addressed by Alexander to Kleander<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span> and Menidas, the officers immediately
subordinate to Parmenio at Ekbatana; proclaiming Parmenio guilty of
high treason, and directing them to kill him at once. Large rewards
were offered to Polydamas if he performed this commission with
success, while his two brothers were retained as hostages against
scruples or compunction. He promised even more than was demanded—too
happy to purchase this reprieve from what had seemed impending
death. Furnished with native guides and with swift dromedaries,
he struck by the straightest road across the desert of Khorasan,
and arrived at Ekbatana on the eleventh day—a distance usually
requiring more than thirty days to traverse.<a id="FNanchor_471"
href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Entering the camp by
night, without the knowledge of Parmenio, he delivered his despatch
to Kleander, with whom he concerted measures. On the morrow he was
admitted to Parmenio, while walking in his garden with Kleander
and the other officers marked out by Alexander’s order as his
executioners. Polydamas ran to embrace his old friend, and was
heartily welcomed by the unsuspecting veteran, to whom he presented
the letters professedly coming from Alexander and Philotas. While
Parmenio was absorbed in the perusal, he was suddenly assailed by a
mortal stab from the hand and sword of Kleander. Other wounds were
heaped upon him as he fell, by the remaining officers,—the last even
after life had departed.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472"
class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span>The soldiers
in Ekbatana, on hearing of this bloody deed, burst into furious
mutiny, surrounded the garden wall, and threatened to break in for
the purpose of avenging their general, unless Polydamas and the other
murderers should be delivered to them. But Kleander, admitting a few
of the ringleaders, exhi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p.
199]</span>bited to them Alexander’s written orders, to which the
soldiers yielded, not without murmurs of reluctance and indignation.
Most of them dispersed, yet a few remained, entreating permission
to bury Parmenio’s body. Even this was long refused by Kleander,
from dread of the king’s displeasure. At last, however, thinking
it prudent to comply in part, he cut off the head, delivering to
them the trunk alone for burial. The head was sent to Alexander.<a
id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>Among the many tragical deeds recounted throughout the course of
this history, there is none more revolting than the fate of these two
generals. Alexander, violent in all his impulses, displayed on this
occasion a personal rancor worthy of his ferocious mother Olympias,
exasperated rather than softened by the magnitude of past services.<a
id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
When we see the greatest officers of the Macedonian army directing in
person, and under the eye of Alexander, the laceration and burning
of the naked body of their colleague Philotas, and assassinating
with their own hands the veteran Parmenio,—we feel how much we have
passed out of the region of Greek civic feeling into that of the more
savage Illyrian warrior, partially orientalized. It is not surprising
to read, that Antipater, viceroy of Macedonia, who had shared with
Parmenio the favor and confidence of Philip as well as of Alexander,
should tremble when informed of such proceedings, and cast about
for a refuge against the like possibilities to himself. Many other
officers were alike alarmed and disgusted with the transactions.<a
id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
Hence Alexander, opening and examining the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span> letters sent home from his army to
Macedonia, detected such strong expressions of indignation, that he
thought it prudent to transfer many pronounced malcontents into a
division by themselves, parting them off from the remaining army.<a
id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
Instead of appointing any substitute for Philotas in the command
of the Companion-cavalry, he cast that body into two divisions,
nominating Hephæstion to the command of one and Kleitus to
that of the other.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477"
class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>The autumn and winter were spent by Alexander in reducing
Drangiana, Gedrosia, Arachosia, and the Paropamisadæ; the modern
Seiestan, Afghanistan, and the Western part of Kabul, lying between
Ghazna on the north, Kandahar or Kelat on the south, and Furrah in
the west. He experienced no combined resistance, but his troops
suffered severely from cold and privation.<a id="FNanchor_478"
href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Near the southern
termination of one of the passes of the Hindoo-Koosh (apparently
north-east of the town of Kabul) he founded a new city, called
Alexandria ad Caucasum, where he planted 7000 old soldiers,
Macedonians, and others as colonists.<a id="FNanchor_479"
href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> Towards the close of Winter he crossed
over the mighty range of the Hindoo-Koosh; a march of fifteen days
through regions of snow, and fraught with hardship to his army. On
reaching the north side of these mountains, he found himself in
Baktria.</p>

<p>The Baktrian leader Bessus, who had assumed the title of king,
could muster no more than a small force, with which he laid waste
the country, and then retired across the river Oxus into Sogdiana,
destroying all the boats. Alexander overran Baktria with scarce
any resistance; the chief places, Baktra (Balkh) and Aornos
surrendering to him on the first demonstration of attack. Having
named Artabazus satrap of Baktria, and placed Archelaus with a
garrison in Aornos,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480"
class="fnanchor">[480]</a> he marched northward towards the river
Oxus, the boundary between Baktria and Sogdiana. It was a march of
extreme hardship; reaching for two or three days across a sandy
desert destitute of water, and under very hot weather, The Oxus,
six furlongs in breadth, deep, and rapid, was the most formidable
river that the Macedonians had yet seen.<a id="FNanchor_481"
href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Alexander transported
his army across it on the tent-skins inflated and stuffed with
straw. It seems surprising that Bessus did not avail himself of
this favorable opportunity for resisting a passage in itself so
difficult; he had however been abandoned by his Baktrian cavalry at
the moment when he quitted their territory. Some of his companions,
Spita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span>menes and
others, terrified at the news that Alexander had crossed the Oxus,
were anxious to make their own peace by betraying their leader.<a
id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
They sent a proposition to this effect; upon which Ptolemy with a
light division was sent forward by Alexander, and was enabled, by
extreme celerity of movements, to surprise and seize Bessus in a
village. Alexander ordered that he should be held in chains, naked
and with a collar round his neck, at the side of the road along
which the army were marching. On reaching the spot, Alexander
stopped his chariot, and sternly demanded from Bessus, on what
pretence he had first arrested, and afterwards slain, his king
and benefactor Darius. Bessus replied, that he had not done this
single-handed; others were concerned in it along with him, to
procure for themselves lenient treatment from Alexander. The king
said no more, but ordered Bessus to be scourged, and then sent back
as prisoner to Baktra<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483"
class="fnanchor">[483]</a>—where we shall again hear of him.</p>

<p>In his onward march, Alexander approached a small town, inhabited
by the Branchidæ; descendants of those Branchidæ near<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span> Miletus on the coast
of Ionia, who had administered the great temple and oracle of Apollo
on Cape Poseidion, and who had yielded up the treasures of that
temple to the Persian king Xerxes, 150 years before. This surrender
had brought upon them so much odium, that when the dominion of
Xerxes was overthrown on the coast, they retired with him into the
interior of Asia. He assigned to them lands in the distant region of
Sogdiana, where their descendants had ever since remained; bilingual
and partially dis-hellenized, yet still attached to their traditions
and origin. Delighted to find themselves once more in commerce with
Greeks, they poured forth to meet and welcome the army, tendering
all that they possessed. Alexander, when he heard who they were
and what was their parentage, desired the Milesians in his army to
determine how they should be treated. But as these Milesians were
neither decided nor unanimous, Alexander announced that he would
determine for himself. Having first occupied the city in person
with a select detachment, he posted his army all round the walls,
and then gave orders not only to plunder it, but to massacre the
entire population—men, women, and children. They were slain without
arms or attempt at resistance, resorting to nothing but prayers and
suppliant manifestations. Alexander next commanded the walls to
be levelled, and the sacred groves cut down, so that no habitable
site might remain, nor any thing except solitude and sterility.<a
id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
Such was the revenge taken upon these unhappy vic<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span>tims for the deeds of
their ancestors in the fourth or fifth generation before. Alexander
doubtless considered himself to be executing the wrath of Apollo
against an accursed race who had robbed the temple of the god.<a
id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> The
Macedonian expedition had been proclaimed to be undertaken originally
for the purpose of revenging upon the contemporary Persians the
ancient wrongs done to Greece by Xerxes; so that Alexander would
follow out the same sentiment in revenging upon the contemporary
Branchidæ the acts of their ancestors—yet more guilty than Xerxes,
in his belief. The massacre of this unfortunate population was in
fact an example of human sacrifice on the largest scale, offered
to the gods by the religious impulses of Alexander, and worthy to
be compared to that of the Carthaginian general Hannibal, when he
sacrificed 3000 Grecian prisoners on the field of Himera, where
his grandfather Hamilkar had been slain seventy years before.<a
id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Alexander then continued his onward progress, first to
Marakanda (Samarcand), the chief town of Sogdiana—next, to the
river Jaxartes, which he and his companions, in their imperfect
geographical notions, believed to be the Tanais, the boundary
between Asia, and Europe.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487"
class="fnanchor">[487]</a> In his march, he left garrisons in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span> various towns,<a
id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
but experienced no resistance, though detached bodies of the natives
hovered on his flanks. Some of these bodies, having cut off a few
of his foragers, took refuge afterwards on a steep and rugged
mountain, conceived to be unassailable. Thither however Alexander
pursued them, at the head of his lightest and most active troops.
Though at first repulsed, he succeeded in scaling and capturing
the place. Of its defenders, thirty thousand in number, three
fourths were either put to the sword, or perished in jumping down
the precipices. Several of his soldiers were wounded with arrows,
and he himself received a shot from one of them through his leg.<a
id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> But
here, as elsewhere, we perceive that nearly all the Orientals whom
Alexander subdued were men little suited for close combat hand to
hand,—fighting only with missiles.</p>

<p>Here, on the river Jaxartes, Alexander projected the foundation
of a new city to bear his name; intended partly as a protection
against incursions from the Scythian Nomads on the other side of the
river, partly as a facility for himself to cross over and subdue
them, which he intended to do as soon as he could find opportunity.<a
id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
He was however called off for the time by the news of a wide-spread
revolt among the newly-conquered inhabitants both of Sogdiana and
Baktria. He suppressed the revolt with his habitual vigor and
celerity, distributing his troops so as to capture five townships
in two days, and Kyropolis or Kyra, the largest of the neighboring
Sogdian towns (founded by the Persian Cyrus), immediately
afterwards. He put all the defenders and inhabitants to the sword.
Returning then to the Jaxartes, he completed in twenty days the
fortifications of his new town of Alexandria (perhaps at or near
Khodjend), with suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p.
206]</span> sacrifices and festivities to the gods. He planted in
it some Macedonian veterans and Grecian mercenaries, together with
volunteer settlers from the natives around.<a id="FNanchor_491"
href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> An army of Scythian
Nomads, showing themselves on the other side of the river, piqued his
vanity to cross over and attack them. Carrying over a division of
his army on inflated skins, he defeated them with little difficulty,
pursuing them briskly into the desert. But the weather was intensely
hot, and the army suffered much from thirst; while the little water
to be found was so bad, that it brought upon Alexander a diarrhœa
which endangered his life.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492"
class="fnanchor">[492]</a> This chase, of a few miles on the right
bank of the Jaxartes (seemingly in the present Khanat of Kokand),
marked the utmost limit of Alexander’s progress northward.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, a Macedonian detachment, unskilfully
conducted, was destroyed in Sogdiana by Spitamenes and the
Scythians: a rare misfortune, which Alexander avenged by
overrunning the region<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493"
class="fnanchor">[493]</a> near the river Polytimêtus (the Kohik),
and putting to the sword the inhabitants of all the towns which he
took. He then recrossed the Oxus, to rest during the extreme season
of winter at Zariaspa in Baktria, from whence his communications
with the West and with Macedonia were more easy, and where he
received various reinforcements of Greek troops.<a id="FNanchor_494"
href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Bessus, who had
been here retained as a prisoner, was now brought forward amidst a
public assembly; wherein Alexander, having first reproached him for
his treason to Darius, caused his nose and ears to be cut off—and
sent him in this condition to Ekbatana, to be finally slain by
the Medes and Persians.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495"
class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Mutilation was a practice altogether
Oriental and non-Hellenic:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p.
207]</span> even Arrian, admiring and indulgent as he is towards
his hero, censures this savage order, as one among many proofs how
much Alexander had taken on Oriental dispositions. We may remark
that his extreme wrath on this occasion was founded partly on
disappointment that Bessus had frustrated his toilsome efforts for
taking Darius alive—partly on the fact that the satrap had committed
treason against the king’s person, which it was the policy as well
as the feeling of Alexander to surround with a circle of Deity.<a
id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
For as to traitors against Persia, as a cause and country, Alexander
had never discouraged, and had sometimes signally recompensed them.
Mithrines, the governor of Sardis, who opened to him the gates
of that almost impregnable fortress immediately after the battle
of the Granikus—the traitor who perhaps, next to Darius himself,
had done most harm to the Persian cause—obtained from him high
favor and promotion.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497"
class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>The rude but spirited tribes of Baktria and Sogdiana were as
yet but imperfectly subdued, seconded as their resistance was by
wide spaces of sandy desert, by the neighborhood of the Scythian
Nomads, and by the presence of Spitamenes as a leader. Alexander,
distributing his army into five divisions, traversed the country and
put down all resistance, while he also took measures for establishing
several military posts, or new towns in convenient places.<a
id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
After some time the whole army was reunited at the chief place
of Sogdiana—Marakanda—where some halt and repose was given.<a
id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span>During this
halt at Marakanda (Samarcand) the memorable banquet occurred wherein
Alexander murdered Kleitus. It has been already related that Kleitus
had saved his life at the battle of the Granikus, by cutting off
the sword arm of the Persian Spithridates when already uplifted to
strike him from behind. Since the death of Philotas, the important
function of general of the Companion-cavalry had been divided between
Hephæstion and Kleitus. Moreover, the family of Kleitus had been
attached to Philip, by ties so ancient, that his sister, Lanikê, had
been selected as the nurse of Alexander himself when a child. Two of
her sons had already perished in the Asiatic battles. If, therefore,
there were any man who stood high in the service, or was privileged
to speak his mind freely to Alexander, it was Kleitus.</p>

<p>In this banquet at Marakanda, when wine, according to
the Macedonian habit, had been abundantly drunk, and when
Alexander, Kleitus, and most of the other guests were already
nearly intoxicated, enthusiasts or flatterers heaped immoderate
eulogies upon the king’s past achievements.<a id="FNanchor_500"
href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> They exalted him
above all the most venerated legendary heroes; they proclaimed that
his superhuman deeds proved his divine paternity, and that he had
earned an apotheosis like Herakles, which nothing but envy could
withhold from him during his life. Alexander himself joined in these
boasts, and even took credit for the later victories of the reign
of his father, whose abilities and glory he depreciated. To the old
Macedonian officers, such an insult cast on<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_209">[p. 209]</span> the memory of Philip was deeply
offensive. But among them all, none had been more indignant than
Kleitus, with the growing insolence of Alexander—his assumed
filiation from Zeus Ammon, which put aside Philip as unworthy—his
preference for Persian attendants, who granted or refused admittance
to his person—his extending to Macedonian soldiers the contemptuous
treatment habitually endured by Asiatics, and even allowing them to
be scourged by Persian hands and Persian rods.<a id="FNanchor_501"
href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The pride of a
Macedonian general in the stupendous successes of the last five
years, was effaced by his mortification when he saw that they tended
only to merge his countrymen amidst a crowd of servile Asiatics,
and to inflame the prince with high-flown aspirations transmitted
from Xerxes or Ochus. But whatever might be the internal thoughts of
Macedonian officers, they held their peace before Alexander, whose
formidable character and exorbitant self-estimation would tolerate no
criticism.</p>

<p>At the banquet of Marakanda, this long suppressed repugnance
found an issue, accidental indeed and unpremeditated, but for that
very reason all the more violent and unmeasured. The wine, which
made Alexander more boastful and his flatterers fulsome to excess,
overpowered altogether the reserve of Kleitus. He rebuked the impiety
of those who degraded the ancient heroes in order to make a pedestal
for Alexander. He protested against the injustice of disparaging the
exalted and legitimate fame of Philip; whose achievements he loudly
extolled, pronouncing them to be equal, and even superior to those of
his son. For the exploits of Alexander, splendid as they were, had
been accomplished, not by himself alone, but by that unconquerable
Macedonian force which he had found ready made to his hands;<a
id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
whereas those of Philip had been his own—since he had found Macedonia
prostrate and disorganized, and had had to create for himself
both soldiers, and a military system. The<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span> great instruments of Alexander’s
victories had been Philip’s old soldiers, whom he now despised—and
among them Parmenio, whom he had put to death.</p>

<p>Remarks such as these, poured forth in the coarse language of a
half-intoxicated Macedonian veteran, provoked loud contradiction from
many, and gave poignant offence to Alexander; who now for the first
time heard the open outburst of disapprobation, before concealed
and known to him only by surmise. But wrath and contradiction, both
from him and from others, only made Kleitus more reckless in the
outpouring of his own feelings, now discharged with delight after
having been so long pent up. He passed from the old Macedonian
soldiers to himself individually. Stretching forth his right hand
towards Alexander, he exclaimed—“Recollect that you owe your life
to me; this hand preserved you at the Granikus. Listen to the
outspoken language of truth, or else abstain from asking freemen to
supper, and confine yourself to the society of barbaric slaves.” All
these reproaches stung Alexander to the quick. But nothing was so
intolerable to him as the respectful sympathy for Parmenio, which
brought to his memory one of the blackest deeds of his life—and the
reminiscence of his preservation at the Granikus, which lowered
him into the position of a debtor towards the very censor under
whose reproof he was now smarting. At length wrath and intoxication
together drove him into uncontrollable fury. He started from his
couch, and felt for his dagger to spring at Kleitus; but the dagger
had been put out of reach by one of his attendants. In a loud voice
and with the Macedonian word of command, he summoned the body guards
and ordered the trumpeter to sound an alarm. But no one obeyed so
grave an order, given in his condition of drunkenness. His principal
officers, Ptolemy, Perdikkas and others, clung round him, held his
arms and body, and besought him to abstain from violence; others
at the same time tried to silence Kleitus and hurry him out of the
hall, which had now become a scene of tumult and consternation.
But Kleitus was not in a humor to confess himself in the wrong by
retiring; while Alexander, furious at the opposition now, for the
first time, offered to his will, exclaimed, that his officers held
him in chains as Bessus had held Darius, and left him nothing but the
name of a king.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span>
Though anxious to restrain his movements, they doubtless did not dare
to employ much physical force; so that his great personal strength,
and continued efforts, presently set him free. He then snatched a
pike from one of the soldiers, rushed upon Kleitus, and thrust him
through on the spot, exclaiming, “Go now to Philip and Parmenio”.<a
id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span>No sooner was
the deed perpetrated, than the feelings of Alexander underwent an
entire revolution. The spectacle of Kleitus, a bleeding corpse on
the floor,—the marks of stupefaction and horror evident in all the
spectators, and the reaction from a furious impulse instantaneously
satiated—plunged him at once into the opposite extreme of remorse
and self-condemnation. Hastening out of the hall, and retiring
to bed, he passed three days in an agony of distress, without
food or drink. He burst into tears and multiplied exclamations
on his own mad act; he dwelt upon the name of Kleitus and Lanikê
with the debt of gratitude which he owed to each, and denounced
himself as unworthy to live after having requited such services
with a foul murder.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504"
class="fnanchor">[504]</a> His friends at length prevailed on him to
take food, and return to activity. All joined in trying to restore
his self-satisfaction. The Macedonian army passed a public vote
that Kleitus had been justly slain, and that his body should remain
unburied; which afforded opportunity to Alexander to reverse the
vote, and to direct that it should be buried by his own order.<a
id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span> prophets
comforted him by the assurance that his murderous impulse had arisen,
not from his own natural mind, but from a maddening perversion
intentionally brought on by the god Dionysus, to avenge the omission
of a sacrifice due to him on the day of the banquet, but withheld.<a
id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
Lastly, the Greek sophist or philosopher, Anaxarchus of Abdera,
revived Alexander’s spirits by well-timed flattery, treating his
sensibility as nothing better than generous weakness; reminding
him that in his exalted position of conqueror and Great King, he
was entitled to prescribe what was right and just, instead of
submitting himself to laws dictated from without.<a id="FNanchor_507"
href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Kallisthenes the
philosopher was also summoned, along with Anaxarchus, to the king’s
presence, for the same purpose of offering consolatory reflections.
But he is said to have adopted a tone of discourse altogether
different, and to have given offence rather than satisfaction to
Alexander.</p>

<p>To such remedial influences, and probably still more to the
absolute necessity for action, Alexander’s remorse at length yielded.
Like the other emotions of his fiery soul, it was violent and
overpowering while it lasted. But it cannot be shown to have left
any durable trace on his character, nor any effects justifying the
unbounded admiration of Arrian; who has little but blame to bestow on
the murdered Kleitus, while he expresses the strongest sympathy for
the mental suffering of the murderer.</p>

<p>After ten days,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508"
class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Alexander again put his army in motion,
to complete the subjugation of Sogdiana. He found no enemy capable
of meeting him in pitched battle; yet Spitamenes, with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span> the Sogdians and some
Scythian allies, raised much hostility of detail, which it cost
another year to put down. Alexander underwent the greatest fatigue
and hardships in his marches through the mountainous parts of this
wide, rugged, and poorly supplied country, with rocky positions,
strong by nature, which his enemies sought to defend. One of these
fastnesses, held by a native chief named Sisymithres, seemed
almost unattackable, and was indeed taken rather by intimidation
than by actual force.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509"
class="fnanchor">[509]</a> The Scythians, after a partial success
over a small Macedonian detachment, were at length so thoroughly
beaten and overawed, that they slew Spitamenes and sent his head
to the conqueror as a propitiatory offering.<a id="FNanchor_510"
href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>After a short rest at Naütaka during the extreme winter,
Alexander resumed operations, by attacking a strong post called the
Sogdian Rock, whither a large number of fugitives had assembled,
with an ample supply of provision. It was a precipice supposed
to be inexpugnable; and would seemingly have proved so, in spite
of the energy and abilities of Alexander, had not the occupants
altogether neglected their guard, and yielded at the mere sight
of a handful of Macedonians who had scrambled up the precipice.
Among the captives, taken by Alexander on this rock, were the wife
and family of the Baktrian chief Oxyartes; one of whose daughters,
named Roxana, so captivated Alexander by her beauty that he resolved
to make her his wife.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511"
class="fnanchor">[511]</a> He then passed out of Sogdiana into
the neighboring territory Parætakênê, where there was another
inexpugnable site called the Rock of Choriênes, which he was also
fortunate enough to reduce.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512"
class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>From hence Alexander went to Baktra. Sending Kraterus with a
division to put the last hand to the reduction of Parætakênê, he
himself remained at Baktra, preparing for his expedition across
the Hindoo-Koosh to the conquest of India. As a security for the
tranquillity of Baktria and Sogdiana during his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span> absence, he levied 30,000 young
soldiers from those countries to accompany him.<a id="FNanchor_513"
href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>It was at Baktra that Alexander celebrated his marriage with
the captive Roxana. Amidst the repose and festivities connected
with that event, the Oriental temper which he was now acquiring
displayed itself more forcibly than ever. He could no longer be
satisfied without obtaining prostration, or worship, from Greeks
and Macedonians as well as from Persians; a public and unanimous
recognition of his divine origin and superhuman dignity. Some Greeks
and Macedonians had already rendered to him this homage. Nevertheless
to the greater number, in spite of their extreme deference and
admiration for him, it was repugnant and degrading. Even the
imperious Alexander shrank from issuing public and formal orders on
such a subject; but a manœuvre was concerted, with his privity, by
the Persians and certain compliant Greek sophists or philosophers,
for the purpose of carrying the point by surprise.</p>

<p>During a banquet at Baktra, the philosopher Anaxarchus, addressing
the assembly in a prepared harangue, extolled Alexander’s exploits
as greatly surpassing those of Dionysus and Herakles. He proclaimed
that Alexander had already done more than enough to establish a
title to divine honors from the Macedonians; who, (he said) would
assuredly worship Alexander after his death, and ought in justice
to worship him during his life, forthwith.<a id="FNanchor_514"
href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>This harangue was applauded, and similar sentiments were enforced,
by others favorable to the plan; who proceeded to set the example
of immediate compliance, and were themselves the first to tender
worship. Most of the Macedonian officers sat unmoved, disgusted at
the speech. But though disgusted they said nothing. To reply to a
speech doubtless well-turned and flowing, required some powers of
oratory; moreover, it was well known that whoever dared to reply
stood marked out for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p.
216]</span> antipathy of Alexander. The fate of Kleitus, who had
arraigned the same sentiments in the banqueting hall of Marakanda,
was fresh in the recollection of every one. The repugnance which
many felt, but none ventured to express, at length found an organ in
Kallisthenes of Olynthus.</p>

<p>This philosopher, whose melancholy fate imparts a peculiar
interest to his name, was nephew of Aristotle, and had enjoyed
through his uncle an early acquaintance with Alexander during
the boyhood of the latter. At the recommendation of Aristotle,
Kallisthenes had accompanied Alexander in his Asiatic expedition.
He was a man of much literary and rhetorical talent, which he
turned towards the composition of history—and to the history
of recent times.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515"
class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Alexander, full of ardor for conquest, was
at the same time anxious that his achievements should be commemorated
by poets and men of letters;<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516"
class="fnanchor">[516]</a> there were seasons also when he enjoyed
their conversation. On both these grounds, he invited several of them
to accompany the army. The more prudent among them declined, but
Kallisthenes obeyed, partly in hopes of procuring the reconstitution
of his native city Olynthus, as Aristotle had obtained the like
favor for Stageira.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517"
class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Kallisthenes had composed a narrative
(not preserved) of Alexander’s exploits, which certainly reached to
the battle of Arbela, and may perhaps have gone down farther. The
few fragments of this narrative remaining seem to betoken extreme
admiration, not merely of the bravery and ability, but also of the
transcendent and unbroken good fortune, of Alexander—marking him
out as the chosen favorite of the gods. This feeling was perfectly
natural under the grandeur of the events.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span> Insofar as we can judge from one or two
specimens, Kallisthenes was full of complimentary tribute to the hero
of his history. But the character of Alexander himself had undergone
a material change during the six years between his first landing in
Asia and his campaign in Sogdiana. All his worst qualities had been
developed by unparalleled success and by Asiatic example. He required
larger doses of flattery, and had now come to thirst, not merely for
the reputation of divine paternity, but for the actual manifestations
of worship as towards a god.</p>

<p>To the literary Greeks who accompanied Alexander, this change in
his temper must have been especially palpable and full of serious
consequence; since it was chiefly manifested, not at periods of
active military duty, but at his hours of leisure, when he recreated
himself by their conversation and discourses. Several of these
Greeks—Anaxarchus, Kleon, the poet Agis of Argos—accommodated
themselves to the change, and wound up their flatteries to the pitch
required. Kallisthenes could not do so. He was a man of sedate
character, of simple, severe, and almost unsocial habits—to whose
sobriety the long Macedonian potations were distasteful. Aristotle
said of him, that he was a great and powerful speaker, but that
he had no judgment; according to other reports, he was a vain and
arrogant man, who boasted that Alexander’s reputation and immortality
were dependent on the composition and tone of <i>his</i> history.<a
id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>
Of per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span>sonal
vanity,—a common quality among literary Greeks,—Kallisthenes probably
had his full share. But there is no ground for believing that <i>his</i>
character had altered. Whatever his vanity may have been, it had
given no offence to Alexander during the earlier years, nor would it
have given offence now, had not Alexander himself become a different
man.</p>

<p>On occasion of the demonstration led up by Anaxarchus at the
banquet, Kallisthenes had been invited by Hephæstion to join
in the worship intended to be proposed towards Alexander; and
Hephæstion afterwards alleged, that he had promised to comply.<a
id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
But his actual conduct affords reasonable ground for believing that
he made no such promise; for he not only thought it his duty to
refuse the act of worship, but also to state publicly his reasons
for disapproving it; the more so, as he perceived that most of
the Macedonians present felt like himself. He contended that
the distinction between gods and men was one which could not be
confounded without impiety and wrong. Alexander had amply earned,—as
a man, a general, and a king,—the highest honors compatible with
humanity; but to exalt him into a god would be both an injury to
him, and an offence to the gods. Anaxarchus (he said) was the last
person from whom such a proposition ought to come, because he was
one of those whose only title to Alexander’s society was founded
upon his capacity to give instructive and wholesome counsel.<a
id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>Kallisthenes here spoke out, what numbers of his hearers felt.
The speech was not only approved, but so warmly applauded by the
Macedonians present, especially the older officers,—that Alexander
thought it prudent to forbid all farther discussion upon this
delicate subject. Presently the Persians present, according to
Asiatic custom, approached him and performed their prostration;
after which Alexander pledged, in successive<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> goblets of wine, those Greeks and
Macedonians with whom he had held previous concert. To each of
them the goblet was handed, and each, after drinking to answer the
pledge, approached the king, made his prostration, and then received
a salute. Lastly, Alexander sent the pledge to Kallisthenes, who,
after drinking like the rest, approached him, for the purpose of
receiving the salute, but without any prostration. Of this omission
Alexander was expressly informed by one of the Companions; upon
which he declined to admit Kallisthenes to a salute. The latter
retired, observing, “Then I shall go away, worse off than others as
far as the salute goes.”<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521"
class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>Kallisthenes was imprudent, and even blamable, in making this last
observation, which without any necessity or advantage, aggravated
the offence already given to Alexander. He was more imprudent
still, if we look simply to his own personal safety in standing
forward publicly to protest against the suggestion for rendering
divine honors to that prince, and in thus creating the main offence
which even in itself was inexpiable. But here the occasion was one
serious and important, so as to convert the imprudence into an act
of genuine moral courage. The question was, not about obeying an
order given by Alexander, for no order had been given—but about
accepting or rejecting a motion made by Anaxarchus; which Alexander,
by a shabby, preconcerted manœuvre, affected to leave to the free
decision of the assembly, in full confidence that no one would be
found intrepid enough to oppose it. If one Greek sophist made a
proposition, in itself servile and disgraceful, another sophist could
do himself nothing but honor by entering public protest against
it; more especially since this was done (as we may see by the
report in Arrian) in terms no way insulting, but full of respectful
admiration, towards Alexander personally. The perfect success of
the speech is in itself a proof of the propriety of its tone;<a
id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> for
the Macedonian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span>
officers would feel indifference, if not contempt towards a rhetor
like Kallisthenes, while towards Alexander they had the greatest
deference short of actual worship. There are few occasions on which
the free spirit of Greek letters and Greek citizenship, in their
protest against exorbitant individual insolence, appears more
conspicuous and estimable than in the speech of Kallisthenes.<a
id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>
Arrian disapproves the purpose of Alexander, and strongly blames
the motion of Anaxarchus; nevertheless, such is his anxiety to find
some excuse for Alexander, that he also blames Kallisthenes for
unseasonable frankness, folly, and insolence, in offering opposition.
He might have said with some truth, that Kallisthenes would have done
well to withdraw earlier (if indeed he could have withdrawn without
offence) from the camp of Alexander, in which no lettered Greek could
now associate without abnegating his freedom of speech and sentiment,
and emulating the servility of Anaxarchus. But being present, as
Kallisthenes was, in the hall at Baktra when the proposition of
Anaxarchus was made, and when silence would have been assent—his
protest against it was both seasonable and dignified; and all the
more dignified for being fraught with danger to himself.</p>

<p>Kallisthenes knew that danger well, and was quickly enabled to
recognize it in the altered demeanor of Alexander towards him. He
was, from that day, a marked man in two senses: first, to Alexander
himself, as well as to the rival sophists and all promoters of
the intended deification,—for hatred, and for getting up some
accusatory pretence such as might serve to ruin<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span> him; next, to the more free-spirited
Macedonians, indignant witnesses of Alexander’s increased insolence,
and admirers of the courageous Greek who had protested against the
motion of Anaxarchus. By such men he was doubtless much extolled;
which praises aggravated his danger, as they were sure to be reported
to Alexander. The pretext for his ruin was not long wanting.</p>

<p>Among those who admired and sought the conversation of
Kallisthenes, was Hermolaus, one of the royal pages—the band,
selected from noble Macedonian families, who did duty about the
person of the king. It had happened that this young man, one
of Alexander’s companions in the chase, on seeing a wild boar
rushing up to attack the king, darted his javelin, and slew the
animal. Alexander, angry to be anticipated in killing the boar,
ordered Hermolaus to be scourged before all the other pages, and
deprived him of his horse.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524"
class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Thus humiliated and outraged—for an
act not merely innocent, but the omission of which, if Alexander
had sustained any injury from the boar, might have been held
punishable—Hermolaus became resolutely bent on revenge.<a
id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
He enlisted in the project his intimate friend Sostratus, with
several others among the pages, and it was agreed among them to kill
Alexander in his chamber, on the first night when they were all on
guard together. The appointed night arrived, without any divulgation
of their secret; yet the scheme was frustrated by the accident,
that Alexander continued till daybreak drinking with his officers,
and never retired to bed. On the morrow, one of the conspirators,
becoming alarmed or repentant, divulged the scheme to his friend
Charikles, with the names of those concerned. Eurylochus, brother to
Charikles, apprised by him of what he had heard, immediately informed
Ptolemy, through whom it was conveyed to Alexander. By Alexander’s
order, the persons indicated were arrested and put to the torture;<a
id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
under which they confessed that they had themselves conspired to
kill him, but named no other accomplices, and even denied that
any one else was privy to the scheme. In<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span> this denial they persisted, though
extreme suffering was applied to extort the revelation of new
names. They were then brought up and arraigned as conspirators
before the assembled Macedonian soldiers. There their confession
was repeated. It is even said that Hermolaus, in repeating it,
boasted of the enterprise as legitimate and glorious; denouncing
the tyranny and cruelty of Alexander us having become insupportable
to a freeman. Whether such boast was actually made or not, the
persons brought up were pronounced guilty, and stoned to death
forthwith by the soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527"
class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The pages thus executed were young men of good Macedonian
families, for whose condemnation accordingly, Alexander had thought
it necessary to invoke—what he was sure of obtaining against any
one—the sentence of the soldiers. To satisfy his hatred against
Kallisthenes—not a Macedonian, but only a Greek citizen, one of
the surviving remnants of the subverted city of Olynthus—no such
formality was required.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528"
class="fnanchor">[528]</a> As yet, there was not a shadow of
proof to implicate this philosopher; for obnoxious as his name
was known to be, Hermolaus and his companions had, with exemplary
fortitude, declined to purchase the chance of respite from extreme
torture by pronouncing it. Their confessions,—all extorted by
suffering, unless confirmed by other evidence, of which we do
not know whether any was taken—were hardly of the least value,
even against themselves; but against Kallisthenes, they had no
bearing whatever; nay, they tended indirectly, not to convict, but
to absolve him. In his case, therefore, as in that of Philotas
before, it was necessary to pick up matter of suspicious tendency
from his reported remarks and conversations. He was alleged<a
id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span> have addressed
dangerous and inflammatory language to the pages, holding up
Alexander to odium, instigating them to conspiracy, and pointing out
Athens as a place of refuge; he was moreover well known to have been
often in conversation with Hermolaus. For a man of the violent temper
and omnipotent authority of Alexander, such indications were quite
sufficient as grounds of action against one whom he hated.</p>

<p>On this occasion, we have the state of Alexander’s mind disclosed
by himself, in one of the references to his letters given by
Plutarch. Writing to Kraterus and to others immediately afterwards,
Alexander distinctly stated that the pages throughout all their
torture had deposed against no one but themselves. Nevertheless,
in another letter, addressed to Antipater in Macedonia, he
used these expressions—“The pages were stoned to death by the
Macedonians; but I myself shall punish the sophist, as well as
those who sent him out here, and those who harbor in their cities
conspirators against me.”<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530"
class="fnanchor">[530]</a> The sophist Kallisthenes had been sent
out by Aristotle, who is here designated; and probably the Athenians
after him. Fortunately for Aristotle, he was not at Baktra, but at
Athens. That he could have had any concern in the conspiracy of the
pages, was impossible. In this savage outburst of menace against his
absent preceptor, Alexan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[p.
224]</span>der discloses the real state of feeling which prompted him
to the destruction of Kallisthenes; hatred towards that spirit of
citizenship and free speech, which Kallisthenes not only cherished,
in common with Aristotle and most other literary Greeks, but had
courageously manifested in his protest against the motion for
worshipping a mortal.</p>

<p>Kallisthenes was first put to the torture and then hanged.<a
id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
His tragical fate excited a profound sentiment of sympathy and
indignation among the philosophers of antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_532"
href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>The halts of Alexander were formidable to friends and companions;
his marches, to the unconquered natives whom he chose to treat as
enemies. On the return of Kraterus from Sogdiana, Alexander began
his march from Baktra (Balkh) southward to the mountain range
Paropamisus or Caucasus (Hindoo-Koosh); leaving however at Baktra
Amyntas, with a large force of 10,000 foot and 3500 horse, to keep
these intractable territories in subjugation.<a id="FNanchor_533"
href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> His march over the
mountains occupied ten days; he then visited his newly-founded city
Alexandria in the Paropamisadæ. At or near the river Kophen (Kabool
river), he was joined by Taxiles, a powerful Indian prince, who
brought as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p. 225]</span>
present twenty-five elephants, and whose alliance was very valuable
to him. He then divided his army, sending one division under
Hephæstion and Perdikkas, towards the territory called Peukelaôtis
(apparently that immediately north of the confluence of the Kabool
river with the Indus); and conducting the remainder himself in
an easterly direction, over the mountainous regions between the
Hindoo-Koosh and the right bank of the Indus. Hephæstion was ordered,
after subduing all enemies in his way, to prepare a bridge ready
for passing the Indus by the time when Alexander should arrive.
Astes, prince of Peukelaôtis, was taken and slain in the city where
he had shut himself up; but the reduction of it cost Hephæstion
a siege of thirty days.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534"
class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>Alexander, with his own half of the army, undertook the
reduction of the Aspasii, the Guræi, and the Assakeni, tribes
occupying mountainous and difficult localities along the southern
slopes of the Hindoo-Koosh; but neither they nor their various
towns mentioned—Arigæon, Massaga, Bazira, Ora, Dyrta, etc.,
except perhaps the remarkable rock of Aornos,<a id="FNanchor_535"
href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> near the Indus<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>—can be more exactly
identified. These tribes were generally brave, and seconded by towns
of strong position as well as by a rugged country, in many parts
utterly without roads.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536"
class="fnanchor">[536]</a> But their defence was conducted with
little union, no military skill, and miserable weapons; so that they
were no way qualified to op<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p.
227]</span>pose the excellent combination and rapid movements of
Alexander, together with the confident attack and very superior
arms, offensive, as well as defensive, of his soldiers. All those
who attempted resistance were successively attacked, overpowered and
slain. Even those who did not resist, but fled to the mountains, were
pursued, and either slaughtered or sold for slaves. The only way of
escaping the sword was to remain, submit, and await the fiat of the
invader. Such a series of uninterrupted successes, all achieved with
little loss, it is rare in military history to read. The capture of
the rock of Aornos was peculiarly gratifying to Alexander, because
it enjoyed the legendary reputation of having been assailed in vain
by Herakles—and indeed he himself had deemed it, at first sight,
unassailable. After having thus subdued the upper regions (above
Attock or the confluence of the Kabul river) on the right bank of
the Indus, he availed himself of some forests alongside to fell
timber and build boats. These boats were sent down the stream, to the
point where Hephæstion and Perdikkas were preparing the bridge.<a
id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>Such fatiguing operations of Alexander, accomplished amidst all
the hardships of winter, were followed by a halt of thirty days, to
refresh the soldiers before he crossed the Indus, in the early spring
of 326 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a id="FNanchor_538"
href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> It is presumed,
probably enough, that he crossed at or near Attock, the passage now
frequented. He first marched to Taxila, where the prince Taxilus at
once submitted, and reinforced the army with a strong contingent of
Indian soldiers. His alliance and information was found extremely
valuable. The whole neighboring territory submitted, and was placed
under Philippus as satrap, with a garrison and depôt at Taxila.
He experienced no resistance until he reached the river Hydaspes
(Jelum), on the other side of which the Indian prince Porus stood
prepared to dispute the passage; a brave man, with a formidable
force, better armed than Indians generally were, and with many
trained elephants; which animals the Macedonians had never yet
encountered in battle. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p.
228]</span> a series of admirable military combinations, Alexander
eluded the vigilance of Porus, stole the passage of the river at a
point a few miles above, and completely defeated the Indian army. In
spite of their elephants, which were skilfully managed, the Indians
could not long withstand the shock of close combat, against such
cavalry and infantry as the Macedonian. Porus, a prince of gigantic
stature, mounted on an elephant, fought with the utmost gallantry,
rallying his broken troops and keeping them together until the last.
Having seen two of his sons slain, himself wounded and perishing
with thirst, he was only preserved by the special directions of
Alexander. When Porus was brought before him, Alexander was struck
with admiration at his stature, beauty, and undaunted bearing.<a
id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
Addressing him first, he asked, what Porus wished to be done for
him. “That you should treat me as a king,” was the reply of Porus.
Alexander, delighted with these words, behaved towards Porus with the
utmost courtesy and generosity; not only ensuring to him his actual
kingdom, but enlarging it by new additions. He found in Porus a
faithful and efficient ally. This was the greatest day of Alexander’s
life; if we take together the splendor and difficulty of the military
achievement, and the generous treatment of his conquered opponent.<a
id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span>Alexander
celebrated his victory by sacrifices to the gods, and festivities
on the banks of the Hydaspes; where he also gave directions for
the foundation of two cities—Nikæa, on the eastern bank; and
Bukephalia, on the western, so named in commemoration of his favorite
horse, who died here of age and fatigue.<a id="FNanchor_541"
href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Leaving Kraterus
to lay out and erect these new estab<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span>lishments, as well as to keep up
communication, he conducted his army onward in an easterly
direction towards the river Akesines (Chenab).<a id="FNanchor_542"
href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> His recent victory
had spread terror around; the Glaukæ, a powerful Indian tribe, with
thirty-seven towns and many populous villages, submitted, and were
placed under the dominion of Porus; while embassies of submission
were also received from two considerable princes—Abisares, and a
second Porus, hitherto at enmity with his namesake. The passage of
the great river Akesines, now full and impetuous in its current,
was accomplished by boats and by inflated hides, yet not without
difficulty and danger. From thence he proceeded onward in the
same direction, across the Punjab—finding no enemies, but leaving
detachments at suitable posts to keep up his communications and
ensure his supplies—to the river Hydraotes or Ravee; which, though
not less broad and full than the Akesines, was comparatively
tranquil, so as to be crossed with facility.<a id="FNanchor_543"
href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> Here some free
Indian tribes, Kathæans and others, had the courage to resist. They
first attempted to maintain themselves in Sangala by surrounding
their town with a triple entrenchment of waggons. These being
attacked and carried, they were driven within the walls, which they
now began to despair of defending, and resolved to evacuate by
night. But the project was divulged to Alexander by deserters, and
frustrated by his vigilance. On the next day, he took the town by
storm, putting to the sword 17,000 Indians, and taking (according to
Arrian) 70,000 captives. His own loss before the town was less than
100 killed, and 1200 wounded. Two neighboring towns, in alliance
with Sangala, were evacuated by their terrified inhabitants.
Alexander pursued, but could not overtake them, except 500 sick or
weakly persons, whom his soldiers put to death. Demolishing<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span> the town of Sangala, he
added the territory to the dominion of Porus, then present, with a
contingent of 5000 Indians.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544"
class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Sangala was the easternmost of all Alexander’s conquests.
Presently his march brought him to the river Hyphasis (Sutledge),
the last of the rivers in the Punjab—seemingly at a point below
its confluence with the Beas. Beyond this river, broad and rapid,
Alexander was informed that there lay a desert of eleven days’ march,
extending to a still greater river called the Ganges; beyond which
dwelt the Gandaridæ, the most powerful, warlike, and populous, of
all the Indian tribes, distinguished for the number and training
of their elephants.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545"
class="fnanchor">[545]</a> The prospect of a difficult march, and
of an enemy esteemed invincible, only instigated his ardor. He gave
orders for the crossing. But here for the first time his army,
officers as well as soldiers, manifested symptoms of uncontrollable
weariness; murmuring aloud at these endless toils, and marches they
knew not whither. They had already over-passed the limits where
Dionysus and Herakles were said to have stopped: they were travelling
into regions hitherto unvisited either by Greeks or by Persians,
merely for the purpose of provoking and conquering new enemies. Of
victories they were sated; of their plunder, abundant as it was,
they had no enjoyment;<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546"
class="fnanchor">[546]</a> the hardships of a perpetual onward march,
often excessively accelerated, had exhausted both men and horses;
moreover, their advance from the Hydaspes had been accomplished in
the wet season, under rains more violent and continued than they had
ever before experienced.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547"
class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Informed of the reigning discontent,
Alexander assembled his officers and harangued them, endeavoring
to revive in them that forward spirit and promptitude which he had
hitherto found not inade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p.
232]</span>quate to his own.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548"
class="fnanchor">[548]</a> But he entirely failed. No one indeed
dared openly to contradict him. Kœnus alone hazarded some words
of timid dissuasion; the rest manifested a passive and sullen
repugnance, even when he proclaimed that those who desired might
return, with the shame of having deserted their king, while he would
march forward with the volunteers only. After a suspense of two days,
passed in solitary and silent mortification—he still apparently
persisted in his determination, and offered the sacrifice usual
previous to the passage of a river. The victims were inauspicious;
he bowed to the will of the gods; and gave orders for return, to the
unanimous and unbounded delight of his army.<a id="FNanchor_549"
href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>To mark the last extremity of his eastward progress, he erected
twelve altars of extraordinary height and dimension on the western
bank of the Hyphasis, offering sacrifices of thanks to the gods, with
the usual festivities, and matches of agility and force. Then, having
committed all the territory west of the Hyphasis to the government
of Porus, he marched back, repassed the Hydraotes and Akesines, and
returned to the Hydaspes near the point where<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span> he had first crossed it. The two new
cities—Bukephalia and Nikæa—which he had left orders for commencing
on that river, had suffered much from the rains and inundations
during his forward march to the Hyphasis, and now required
the aid of the army to repair the damage.<a id="FNanchor_550"
href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> The heavy rains
continued throughout most of his return march to the Hydaspes.<a
id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p>On coming back to this river, Alexander received a large
reinforcement both of cavalry and infantry, sent to him from
Europe, together with 25,000 new panoplies, and a considerable
stock of medicines.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552"
class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Had these reinforcements reached him on
the Hyphasis, it seems not impossible that he might have prevailed
on his army to accompany him in his farther advance to the Ganges
and the regions beyond. He now employed himself, assisted by Porus
and Taxilus, in collecting and constructing a fleet for sailing
down the Hydaspes and thence down to the mouth of the Indus. By the
early part of November, a fleet of nearly 2000 boats or vessels
of various sizes having been prepared, he began his voyage.<a
id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
Kraterus marched with one division of the army, along the right bank
of the Hydaspes—Hephæstion on the left bank with the remainder,
including 200 elephants; Nearchus had the command of the fleet in
the river, on board of which was Alexander himself. He pursued his
voyage slowly down the river, to the confluence of the Hydaspes
with the Akesines—with the Hydraotes—and with the Hyphasis—all
pouring, in one united stream, into the Indus. He sailed down the
Indus to its junction with the Indian Ocean. Altogether this voyage
occupied nine months,<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554"
class="fnanchor">[554]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p.
234]</span> from November 326 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
to August 325 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> But it was a
voyage full of active military operations on both sides of the
river. Alexander perpetually disembarked to attack, subdue, and
slaughter all such nations near the banks as did not voluntarily
submit. Among them were the Malli and Oxydrakæ, free and brave
tribes, who resolved to defend their liberty, but, unfortunately
for themselves, were habitually at variance, and could not now
accomplish any hearty co-operation against the common invader.<a
id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Alexander first assailed the Malli with his usual celerity and
vigor, beat them with slaughter in the field, and took several
of their towns.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556"
class="fnanchor">[556]</a> There remained only their last and
strongest town, from which the defenders were already driven
out and forced to retire to the citadel.<a id="FNanchor_557"
href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Thither they were
pursued by the Macedonians, Alexander being among the foremost, with
only a few guards near him. Impatient because the troops with their
scaling-ladders did not come up more rapidly, he mounted upon a
ladder that happened to be at hand, attended only by Peukestes and
one or two others, with an adventurous courage even transcending
what he was wont to display. Having cleared the wall by killing
several of its defenders, he jumped down into the interior of the
citadel, and made head for some time, nearly alone, against all
within. He received however a bad wound from an arrow in the breast,
and was on the point of fainting, when his soldiers burst in,
rescued him, and took the place. Every person within, man, woman,
and child, was slain.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558"
class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>The wound of Alexander was so severe, that he was at first
reported to be dead to the great consternation and distress
of the army. However, he became soon sufficiently recovered
to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>
himself, and to receive their ardent congratulations, in the camp
established at the point of junction between the Hydraotes (Ravee)
and Akesines (Chenab).<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559"
class="fnanchor">[559]</a> His voyage down the river, though
delayed by the care of his wound, was soon resumed and prosecuted,
with the same active operations by his land-force on both sides
to subjugate all the Indian tribes and cities within accessible
distance. At the junction of the river Akesines (Punjnud) with
the Indus, Alexander directed the foundation of a new city, with
adequate docks and conveniences for ship-building, whereby he
expected to command the internal navigation.<a id="FNanchor_560"
href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> Having no farther
occasion now for so large a land-force, he sent a large portion of
it, under Kraterus, westward (seemingly through the pass now called
Bolan) into Karmania.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561"
class="fnanchor">[561]</a> He established another military and naval
post at Pattala, where the Delta of the Indus divided; and he then
sailed, with a portion of his fleet, down the right arm of the river
to have the first sight of the Indian Ocean. The view of ebbing
and flowing tide, of which none had had experience on the scale
there exhibited, occasioned to all much astonishment and alarm.<a
id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>The fleet was now left to be conducted by the admiral Nearchus,
from the mouth of the Indus round by the Persian Gulf to that of
the Tigris: a memorable nautical enterprise in Grecian antiquity.
Alexander himself (about the month of August) began his march by
land westward through the territories of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span> Arabitæ and the Oritæ, and afterwards
through the deserts of Gedrosia. Pura, the principal town of the
Gedrosians, was sixty days’ march from the boundary of the Oritæ.<a
id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>Here his army, though without any formidable opposing enemy,
underwent the most severe and deplorable sufferings; their march
being through a sandy and trackless desert, with short supplies
of food and still shorter supplies of water, under a burning sun.
The loss in men, horses, and baggage-cattle from thirst, fatigue,
and disease was prodigious; and it required all the unconquerable
energy of Alexander to bring through even the diminished number.<a
id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>
At Pura the army obtained repose and refreshment, and was enabled
to march forward into Karmania, where Kraterus joined them with
his division from the Indus, and Kleander with the division which
had been left at Ekbatana. Kleander, accused of heinous crimes in
his late command, was put to death or imprisoned: several of his
comrades were executed. To recompense the soldiers for their recent
distress in Gedrosia, the king conducted them for seven days in
drunken bacchanalian procession through Karmania, himself and all
his friends taking part in the revelry; an imitation of the jovial
festivity and triumph with which the god Dionysus had marched back
from the conquest of India.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565"
class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>During
the halt in Karmania Alexander had the satisfaction of seeing
his admiral Nearchus,<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566"
class="fnanchor">[566]</a> who had brought the fleet round from
the mouth of the Indus to the harbor called Harmozeia (Ormuz),
not far from the entrance of the Persian Gulf; a voyage of much
hardship and distress, along the barren coasts of the Oritæ,
the Gedrosians, and the Ichthyophagi.<a id="FNanchor_567"
href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Nearchus, highly
commended and honored, was presently sent back to complete his
voyage as far as the mouth of the Euphrates; while Hephæstion
also was directed to conduct the larger portion of the army, with
the elephants and heavy baggage, by the road near the coast from
Karmania into Persis. This road, though circuitous, was the most
convenient, as it was now the winter season;<a id="FNanchor_568"
href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> but Alexander
himself, with the lighter divisions of his army, took the more
direct mountain road from Karmania to Pasargadæ and Persepolis.
Visiting the tomb of Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian empire,
he was incensed to find it violated and pillaged. He caused it to
be carefully restored, put to death a Macedonian named Polymachus
as the offender, and tortured the Magian guardians of it for the
purpose of discovering accomplices, but in vain.<a id="FNanchor_569"
href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Orsines, satrap of
Persis, was however accused of connivance in the deed, as well as
of various acts of murder and spoliation: according to Curtius,
he was not only innocent, but had manifested both good faith and
devotion to Alexander;<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570"
class="fnanchor">[570]</a> in spite of which he became a victim of
the hostility of the favorite eunuch Bagoas, who both poisoned the
king’s mind with calumnies of his own, and suborned other accusers
with false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span>
testimony. Whatever may be the truth of the story, Alexander caused
Orsines to be hanged; naming as satrap Peukestes, whose favor
was now high, partly as comrade and preserver of the king in his
imminent danger at the citadel of the Malli,—partly from his having
adopted the Persian dress, manners, and language more completely
than any other Macedonian.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571"
class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>It was about February, in 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,<a
id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
that Alexander marched out of Persis to Susa. During this progress,
at the point where he crossed the Pasitigris, he was again joined by
Nearchus, who having completed his circumnavigation from the mouth of
the Indus to that of the Euphrates, had sailed back with the fleet
from the latter river and come up the Pasitigris.<a id="FNanchor_573"
href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> It is probable that
the division of Hephæstion also rejoined him at Susa, and that the
whole army was there for the first time brought together, after the
separation in Karmania.</p>

<p>In Susa and Susiana Alexander spent some months. For the first
time since his accession to the throne, he had now no military
operations in hand or in immediate prospect. No enemy was before
him, until it pleased him to go in quest of a new one;<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span>—nor indeed could any
new one be found, except at a prodigious distance. He had emerged
from the perils of the untrodden East, and had returned into the
ordinary localities and conditions of Persian rule, occupying
that capital city from whence the great Achæmenid kings had been
accustomed to govern the Western as well as the Eastern portions of
their vast empire. To their post, and to their irritable love of
servility, Alexander had succeeded; but bringing with him a restless
energy such as none of them except the first founder Cyrus had
manifested—and a splendid military genius, such as was unknown alike
to Cyrus and to his successors.</p>

<p>In the new position of Alexander, his principal subjects of
uneasiness were, the satraps and the Macedonian soldiers. During
the long interval (more than five years) which had elapsed since he
marched eastward from Hyrkania in pursuit of Bessus, the satraps had
necessarily been left much to themselves. Some had imagined that he
would never return; an anticipation noway unreasonable, since his
own impulse towards forward march was so insatiate that he was only
constrained to return by the resolute opposition of his own soldiers;
moreover his dangerous wound among the Malli, and his calamitous
march through Gedrôsia, had given rise to reports of his death,
credited for some time even by Olympias and Kleopatra in Macedonia.<a
id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
Under these uncertainties, some satraps stood accused of having
pillaged rich temples, and committed acts of violence towards
individuals. Apart from all criminality, real or alleged, several of
them, also, had taken into pay bodies of mercenary troops, partly
as a necessary means of authority in their respective districts,
partly as a protection to themselves in the event of Alexander’s
decease. Respecting the conduct of the satraps and their officers,
many denunciations and complaints were sent in; to which Alexander
listened readily and even eagerly, punishing the accused with
indiscriminate rigor, and resenting especially the suspicion
that they had calculated upon his death.<a id="FNanchor_575"
href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Among those
executed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span> were
Abulites, satrap of Susiana, with his son Oxathres; the latter was
even slain by the hands of Alexander himself, with a sarissa<a
id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>—the
dispensation of punishment becoming in his hands an outburst
of exasperated temper. He also despatched peremptory orders
to all the satraps, enjoining them to dismiss their mercenary
troops without delay.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577"
class="fnanchor">[577]</a> This measure produced considerable
effect on the condition of Greece—about which I shall speak in a
subsequent chapter. Harpalus, satrap of Babylon (about whom also
more, presently), having squandered large sums out of the revenues of
the post upon ostentatious luxury, became terrified when Alexander
was approaching Susiana, and fled to Greece with a large treasure and
a small body of soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578"
class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Serious alarm was felt among all the
satraps and officers, inno<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p.
241]</span>cent as well as guilty. That the most guilty were
not those who fared worst, we may see by the case of Kleomenes
in Egypt, who remained unmolested in his government, though his
iniquities were no secret.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579"
class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p>Among the Macedonian soldiers, discontent had been perpetually
growing, from the numerous proofs which they witnessed that Alexander
had made his election for an Asiatic character, and abnegated his own
country. Besides his habitual adoption of the Persian costume and
ceremonial, he now celebrated a sort of national Asiatic marriage at
Susa. He had already married the captive Roxana, in Baktria; he next
took two additional wives—Statira, daughter of Darius—and Parysatis,
daughter of the preceding king Ochus. He at the same time caused
eighty of his principal friends and officers, some very reluctantly,
to marry (according to Persian rites) wives selected from the
noblest Persian families, providing dowries for all of them.<a
id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
He made presents besides, to all those Macedonians who gave in
their names as having married Persian women. Splendid festivities<a
id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
accompanied these nuptials, with honorary rewards distributed to
favorites and meritorious officers. Macedonians and Persians, the
two imperial races, one in Europe, the other in Asia, were thus
intended to be amalgamated. To soften the aversion of the soldiers
generally towards these Asiatising marriages,<a id="FNanchor_582"
href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Alexander issued
proclamation that he would himself discharge their debts, inviting
all who owed money to give in their names with an intimation of the
sums due. It was known that the debtors were numerous; yet few came
to enter their names. The soldiers suspected the proclamation as
a stratagem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span>
intended for the purpose of detecting such as were spendthrifts,
and obtaining a pretext for punishment: a remarkable evidence
how little confidence or affection Alexander now inspired, and
how completely the sentiment entertained towards him was that of
fear mingled with admiration. He himself was much hurt at their
mistrust, and openly complained of it; at the same time proclaiming
that paymasters and tables should be planted openly in the camp,
and that any soldier might come and ask for money enough to pay
his debts, without being bound to give in his name. Assured of
secrecy, they now made application in such numbers that the total
distributed was prodigiously great; reaching, according to some, to
10,000 talents—according to Arrian, not less than 20,000 talents
or £4,600,000 sterling.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583"
class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>Large as this donative was, it probably gave but partial
satisfaction, since the most steady and well-conducted soldiers could
have received no benefit, except in so far as they might choose to
come forward with fictitious debts. A new modification moreover was
in store for the soldiers generally. There arrived from the various
satrapies—even from those most distant, Sogdiana, Baktria, Aria,
Drangiana, Arachosia, etc.—contingents of young and fresh native
troops, amounting in total to 30,000 men; all armed and drilled
in the Macedonian manner. From the time when the Macedonians had
refused to cross the river Hyphasis and march forward into India,
Alexander saw, that for his large aggressive schemes it was necessary
to disband the old soldiers, and to organize an army at once more
fresh and more submissive. He accordingly despatched orders to the
satraps to raise and discipline new Asiatic levies, of vigorous
native youths; and the fruit of these orders was now seen.<a
id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>
Alexander reviewed the new levies, whom he called the Epigoni, with
great satisfaction. He moreover incorporated many native Persians,
both officers and soldiers, into the Companion-cavalry, the most
honorable service in the army; making the important change of
arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span>ing them
with the short Macedonian thrusting-pike in place of the missile
Persian javelin. They were found such apt soldiers, and the genius
of Alexander for military organization was so consummate, that he
saw himself soon released from his dependence on the Macedonian
veterans; a change evident enough to them as well as to him.<a
id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>The novelty and success of Nearchus in his exploring voyage had
excited in Alexander an eager appetite for naval operations. Going
on board his fleet in the Pasitigris (the Karun, the river on the
east side of Susa), he sailed in person down to the Persian Gulf,
surveyed the coast as far as the mouth of the Tigris, and then
sailed up the latter river as far as Opis. Hephæstion meanwhile,
commanding the army, marched by land in concert with this voyage, and
came back to Opis, where Alexander disembarked.<a id="FNanchor_586"
href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>Sufficient experiment had now been made with the Asiatic levies,
to enable Alexander to dispense with many of his Macedonian veterans.
Calling together the army, he intimated his intention of sending
home those who were unfit for service either from age or wounds, but
of allotting to them presents at departure sufficient to place them
in an enviable condition, and attract fresh Macedonian substitutes.
On hearing this intimation, all the long-standing discontent of the
soldiers at once broke out. They felt themselves set aside as worn
out and useless,—and set aside, not to make room for younger men of
their own country, but in favor of those Asiatics into whose arms
their king had now passed. They demanded with a loud voice that he
should dismiss them all—advising him by way of taunt to make his
future conquests along with his father Ammon. These manifestations so
incensed Alexander, that he leaped down from the elevated platform on
which he had stood to speak, rushed with a few of his guards among
the crowd of soldiers, and seized or caused to be seized thirteen
of those apparently most forward, ordering them immediately to be
put to death. The multitude were thoroughly overawed and reduced to
silence, upon which Alexander remounted the platform and addressed
them in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span> speech
of considerable length. He boasted of the great exploits of Philip,
and of his own still greater: he affirmed that all the benefit of
his conquests had gone to the Macedonians, and that he himself
had derived from them nothing but a double share of the common
labors, hardships, wounds, and perils. Reproaching them as base
deserters from a king who had gained for them all these unparalleled
acquisitions, he concluded by giving discharge to all—commanding
them forthwith to depart.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587"
class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>After this speech—teeming (as we read it in Arrian) with that
exorbitant self-exaltation which formed the leading feature in
his character—Alexander hurried away into the palace, where he
remained shut up for two days without admitting any one except his
immediate attendants. His guards departed along with him, leaving
the discontented soldiers stupefied and motionless. Receiving no
farther orders, nor any of the accustomed military indications,<a
id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
they were left in the helpless condition of soldiers constrained to
resolve for themselves, and at the same time altogether dependent
upon Alexander whom they had offended. On the third day, they learnt
that he had convened the Persian officers, and had invested them
with the chief military commands, distributing the newly arrived
Epigoni into divisions of infantry and cavalry, all with Macedonian
military titles, and passing over the Macedonians themselves as if
they did not exist. At this news, the soldiers were overwhelmed with
shame and remorse. They rushed to the gates of the palace, threw down
their arms, and supplicated with tears and groans for Alex<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span>ander’s pardon.
Presently he came out, and was himself moved to tears by seeing their
prostrate deportment. After testifying his full reconciliation,
he caused a solemn sacrifice to be celebrated, coupled with a
multitudinous banquet of mixed Macedonians and Persians. The Grecian
prophets, the Persian magi and all the guests present, united in
prayer and libation for fusion, harmony, and community of empire,
between the two nations.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589"
class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>This complete victory over his own soldiers was probably as
gratifying to Alexander as any one gained during his past life;
carrying as it did a consoling retribution for the memorable stoppage
on the banks of the Hyphasis, which he had neither forgotten nor
forgiven. He selected 10,000 of the oldest and most exhausted among
the soldiers to be sent home under Kraterus, giving to each full pay
until the time of arrival in Macedonia, with a donation of one talent
besides. He intended that Kraterus, who was in bad health, should
remain in Europe as viceroy of Macedonia, and that Antipater should
come out to Asia with a reinforcement of troops.<a id="FNanchor_590"
href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Pursuant to this
resolution, the 10,000 soldiers were now singled out for return,
and separated from the main army. Yet it does not appear that they
actually did return, during the ten months of Alexander’s remaining
life.</p>

<p>Of the important edict issued this summer by Alexander to the
Grecian cities, and read at the Olympic festival in July—directing
each city to recall its exiled citizens—I shall speak in a future
chapter. He had now accomplished his object of organizing a land
force, half Macedonian, half Asiatic. But since the expedition of
Nearchus, he had become bent upon a large extension of his naval
force also; which was indeed an indispensable condition towards
his immediate projects of conquering Arabia, and of pushing both
nautical exploration and aggrandizement from the Persian Gulf round
the Arabian coast. He de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p.
246]</span>spatched orders to the Phenician ports, directing that a
numerous fleet should be built; and that the ships should then be
taken to pieces, and conveyed across to Thapsakus on the Euphrates,
from whence they would sail down to Babylon. At that place, he
directed the construction of other ships from the numerous cypress
trees around—as well as the formation of an enormous harbor in
the river at Babylon, adequate to the accommodation of 1000 ships
of war. Mikkalus, a Greek of Klazomenæ, was sent to Phenicia with
500 talents, to enlist, or to purchase, seamen for the crews.
It was calculated that these preparations (probably under the
superintendence of Nearchus) would be completed by the spring,
for which period contingents were summoned to Babylon for the
expedition against Arabia.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591"
class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, Alexander himself paid a visit to Ekbatana,
the ordinary summer residence of the Persian kings. He conducted
his army by leisurely marches, reviewing by the way the ancient
regal parks of the celebrated breed called Nisæan horses now
greatly reduced in number.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592"
class="fnanchor">[592]</a> On the march, a violent altercation
occurred between his personal favorite Hephæstion,—and his secretary
Eumenes, the most able, dexterous, and long-sighted man in his
service. Eumenes, as a Greek of Kardia, had been always regarded
with slight and jealousy by the Macedonian officers, especially
by Hephæstion; Alexander now took pains to reconcile the two,
experiencing no difficulty with Eumenes, but much with Hephæstion.<a
id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
During his stay at Ekbatana, he celebrated magnificent sacrifices
and festivities, with gymnastic and musical exhibitions, which were
farther enlivened, according to the Macedonian habits, by banquets
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span> excessive
wine-drinking. Amidst these proceedings, Hephæstion was seized with
a fever. The vigor of his constitution emboldened him to neglect
all care or regimen, so that in a few days the disease carried him
off. The final crisis came on suddenly, and Alexander was warned of
it while sitting in the theatre; but though he instantly hurried
to the bedside, he found Hephæstion already dead. His sorrow for
this loss was unbounded, manifesting itself in excesses suitable to
the general violence of his impulses, whether of affection or of
antipathy. Like Achilles mourning for Patroklus, he cast himself
on the ground near the dead body, and remained there wailing for
several hours; he refused all care, and even food, for two days;
he cut his hair close, and commanded that all the horses and mules
in the camp should have their manes cut close also; he not only
suspended the festivities, but interdicted all music and every sign
of joy in the camp; he directed that the battlements of the walls
belonging to the neighboring cities should be struck off; he hung, or
crucified, the physician Glaukias, who had prescribed for Hephæstion;
he ordered that a vast funeral pile should be erected at Babylon,
at a cost given to us as 10,000 talents (£2,300,000), to celebrate
the obsequies; he sent messengers to the oracle of Ammon, to inquire
whether it was permitted to worship Hephæstion as a god. Many of
those around him, accommodating themselves to this passionate impulse
of the ruler, began at once to show a sort of worship towards the
deceased, by devoting to him themselves and their arms; of which
Eumenes set the example, conscious of his own personal danger, if
Alexander should suspect him of being pleased at the death of his
recent rival. Perdikkas was instructed to convey the body in solemn
procession to Babylon, there to be burnt in state when preparations
should be completed.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594"
class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span>Alexander
stayed at Ekbatana until winter was at hand, seeking distraction from
his grief in exaggerated splendor of festivals and ostentation of
life. His temper became so much more irascible and furious, that no
one approached him without fear, and he was propitiated by the most
extravagant flatteries.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595"
class="fnanchor">[595]</a> At length he roused himself and
found his true consolation, in gratifying the primary passions
of his nature—fighting and man-hunting.<a id="FNanchor_596"
href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Between Media and
Persis, dwelt the tribes called Kossæi, amidst a region of lofty,
trackless, inaccessible mountains. Brave and predatory, they had
defied the attacks of the Persian kings. Alexander now conducted
against them a powerful force, and in spite of increased difficulties
arising from the wintry season, pushed them from point to point,
following them into the loftiest and most impenetrable recesses of
their mountains. These efforts were continued for forty days, under
himself and Ptolemy, until the entire male population was slain;
which passed for an acceptable offering to the manes of Hephæstion.<a
id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>Not long afterwards, Alexander commenced his progress to
Babylon; but in slow marches, farther retarded by various foreign
embassies which met him on the road. So widely had the terror
of his name and achievements been spread, that several of these
envoys came from the most distant regions. There were some
from the various tribes of Lybia—from Carthage—from Sicily and
Sardinia—from the Illyrians and Thracians—from the Lucanians,
Bruttians, and Tuscans, in Italy—nay, even (some affirmed) from
the Romans, as yet a people of moderate power.<a id="FNanchor_598"
href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> But there
were other names yet more surprising<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span>—Æthiopians, from the extreme south,
beyond Egypt—Scythians from the north, beyond the Danube—Iberians and
Gauls, from the far west, beyond the Mediterranean Sea. Legates also
arrived from various Grecian cities, partly to tender congratulations
and compliments upon his matchless successes, partly to remonstrate
against his sweeping mandate for the general restoration of
the Grecian exiles.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599"
class="fnanchor">[599]</a> It was remarked that these Grecian
legates approached him with wreaths on their heads, tendering golden
wreaths to him,—as if they were coming into the presence of a god.<a
id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>
The proofs which Alexander received even from distant tribes with
names and costumes unknown to him, of fear for his enmity and anxiety
for his favor, were such as had never been shown to any historical
person, and such as entirely to explain his superhuman arrogance.</p>

<p>In the midst of this exuberant pride and good fortune, however,
dark omens and prophecies crowded upon him as he approached Babylon.
Of these the most remarkable was, the warning of the Chaldean
priests, who apprised him, soon after he crossed the Tigris, that
it would be dangerous for him to enter that city, and exhorted
him to remain outside of the gates. At first he was inclined to
obey; but his scruples were overruled, either by arguments from
the Greek sophist Anaxarchus, or by the shame of shutting himself
out from the most memorable city of the em<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span>pire, where his great naval preparations
were now going on. He found Nearchus with his fleet, who had come
up from the mouth of the river,—and also the ships directed to be
built in Phenicia, which had come down the river from Thapsakus,
together with large numbers of seafaring men to serve aboard.<a
id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> The
ships of cypress-wood, and the large docks, which he had ordered to
be constructed at Babylon, were likewise in full progress. He lost
no time in concerting with Nearchus the details of an expedition
into Arabia and the Persian Gulf, by his land-force and naval force
coöperating. From various naval officers, who had been sent to survey
the Persian Gulf and now made their reports, he learned that though
there were no serious difficulties within it or along its southern
coast, yet to double the eastern cape which terminated that coast—to
circumnavigate the unknown peninsula of Arabia—and thus to reach the
Red Sea—was an enterprise perilous at least, if not impracticable.<a
id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
But to achieve that which other men thought impracticable, was the
leading passion of Alexander. He resolved to circumnavigate Arabia
as well as to conquer the Arabians, from whom it was sufficient
offence that they had sent no envoys to him. He also contemplated the
foundation of a great maritime city in the interior of the Persian
Gulf, to rival in wealth and commerce the cities of Phenicia.<a
id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>Amidst preparations for this expedition—and while the immense
funeral pile destined for Hephæstion was being built—Alexander
sailed down the Euphrates to the great dyke called Pallakopas, about
ninety miles below Babylon; a sluice constructed by the ancient
Assyrian kings, for the purpose of being opened when the river was
too full, so as to let off the water into<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span> the interminable marshes stretching out
near the western bank. The sluice being reported not to work well,
he projected the construction of a new one somewhat farther down. He
then sailed through the Pallakopas in order to survey the marshes,
together with the tombs of the ancient Assyrian kings which had been
erected among them. Himself steering his vessel, with the kausia
on his head, and the regal diadem above it,<a id="FNanchor_604"
href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> he passed some time
among these lakes and swamps, which were so extensive that his fleet
lost the way among them. He stayed long enough also to direct, and
even commence, the foundation of a new city, in what seemed to
him a convenient spot.<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605"
class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>On returning to Babylon, Alexander found large reinforcements
arrived there—partly under Philoxenus, Menander, and Menidas, from
Lydia and Karia—partly 20,000 Persians, under Peukestes the satrap.
He caused these Persians to be incorporated in the files of the
Macedonian phalanx. According to the standing custom, each of these
files was sixteen deep, and each soldier was armed with the long pike
or sarissa wielded by two hands; the lochage, or front-rank man,
being always an officer receiving double pay, of great strength and
attested valor—and those second and third in the file, as well as the
rearmost man of all, being likewise strong and good men, receiving
larger pay than the rest. Alexander, in his new arrangement, retained
the three first ranks and the rear rank unchanged, as well as the
same depth of file; but he substituted twelve Persians in place
of the twelve Macedonians who followed after the third-rank man;
so that the file was composed first of the lochage and two other
chosen Macedonians, each armed with the sarissa—then of twelve
Persians armed in their own manner with bow or javelin—lastly,
of a Macedonian with his sarissa bringing up the the rear.<a
id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
In this Macedonico-Persian file, the front would have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> only three projecting
pikes, instead of five, as the ordinary Macedonian phalanx presented;
but then, in compensation, the Persian soldiers would be able to
hurl their javelins at an advancing enemy, over the heads of their
three front-rank men. The supervening death of Alexander prevented
the actual execution of this reform, interesting as being his last
project for amalgamating Persians and Macedonians into one military
force.</p>

<p>Besides thus modifying the phalanx, Alexander also passed in
review his fleet, which was now fully equipped. The order was
actually given for departing, so soon as the obsequies of Hephæstion
should be celebrated. This was the last act which remained for him to
fulfil. The splendid funeral pile stood ready—two hundred feet high,
occupying a square area, of which the side was nearly one furlong,
loaded with mostly decorations from the zeal, real and simulated,
of the Macedonian officers. The invention of artists was exhausted,
in long discussions with the king himself, to produce at all cost
an exhibition of magnificence singular and stupendous. The outlay
(probably with addition of the festivals immediately following) is
stated at 12,000 talents, or £2,760,000 sterling.<a id="FNanchor_607"
href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> Alexander awaited
the order from the oracle of Ammon, having sent thither messengers
to inquire what measure of reverential honor he might properly
and piously show to his departed friend.<a id="FNanchor_608"
href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> The answer was now
brought back, intimating that Hephæstion was to be worshipped as a
Hero—the secondary form of worship, not on a level with that paid
to the gods. Delighted with this divine testimony to Hephæstion,
Alexander caused the pile to be lighted, and the obsequies
celebrated, in a manner suitable to the injunctions of the oracle.<a
id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> He
farther directed that magnificent chapels or sacred edifices should
be erected for the worship and honor of Hephæstion, at Alexandria in
Egypt,—at Pella in Macedonia,—and probably in other cities also.<a
id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span>Respecting
the honors intended for Hephæstion at Alexandria, he addressed to
Kleomenes, the satrap of Egypt, a despatch which becomes in part
known to us. I have already stated that Kleomenes was among the
worst of the satraps; having committed multiplied public crimes,
of which Alexander was not uninformed. The regal despatch enjoined
him to erect in commemoration of Hephæstion a chapel on the terra
firma of Alexandria, with a splendid turret on the islet of Pharos;
and to provide besides that all mercantile written contracts, as
a condition of validity, should be inscribed with the name of
Hephæstion. Alexander concluded thus: “If on coming I find the
Egyptian temples and the chapels of Hephæstion completed in the best
manner, I will forgive you for all your past crimes; and in future,
whatever magnitude of crime you may commit, you shall suffer no
bad treatment from me.”<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611"
class="fnanchor">[611]</a> This despatch strikingly illustrates how
much the wrong doings of satraps were secondary considerations in
his view, compared with splendid manifestations towards the gods and
personal attachments towards friends.</p>

<p>The intense sorrow felt by Alexander for the death of
Hephæstion—not merely an attached friend, but of the same age<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span> and exuberant vigor as
himself—laid his mind open to gloomy forebodings from numerous omens,
as well as to jealous mistrust even of his oldest officers. Antipater
especially, no longer protected against the calumnies of Olympias by
the support of Hephæstion,<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612"
class="fnanchor">[612]</a> fell more and more into discredit;
whilst his son Kassander, who had recently come into Asia with a
Macedonian reinforcement, underwent from Alexander during irascible
moments much insulting violence. In spite of the dissuasive warning
of the Chaldean priests,<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613"
class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Alexander had been persuaded to distrust
their sincerity, and had entered Babylon, though not without
hesitation and uneasiness. However, when, after having entered
the town, he went out of it again safely on his expedition for
the survey of the lower Euphrates, he conceived himself to have
exposed them as deceitful alarmists, and returned to the city with
increased confidence, for the obsequies of his deceased friend.<a
id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>The sacrifices connected with these obsequies were on the most
prodigious scale. Victims enough were offered to furnish a feast for
the army, who also received ample distributions of wine. Alexander
himself presided at the feast, and abandoned himself to conviviality
like the rest. Already full of wine, he was persuaded by his
friend Medius to sup with him, and to pass the whole night in yet
farther drinking, with the boisterous indul<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span>gence called by the Greeks Kômus or
Revelry. Having slept off his intoxication during the next day, he in
the evening again supped with Medius, and spent a second night in the
like unmeasured indulgence.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615"
class="fnanchor">[615]</a> It appears that he already had the
seeds of fever upon him, which was so fatally aggravated by this
intemperance that he was too ill to return to his palace. He took
the bath, and slept in the house of Medius; on the next morning,
he was unable to rise. After having been carried out on a couch to
celebrate sacrifice (which was his daily habit), he was obliged to
lie in bed all day. Nevertheless he summoned the generals to his
presence, prescribing all the details of the impending expedition,
and ordering that the land-force should begin its march on the
fourth day following, while the fleet, with himself aboard, would
sail on the fifth day. In the evening, he was carried on a couch
across the Euphrates into a garden on the other side, where he
bathed and rested for the night. The fever still continued, so that
in the morning, after bathing and being carried out to perform the
sacrifices, he remained on his couch all day, talking and playing at
dice with Medius; in the evening, he bathed, sacrificed again, and
ate a light supper, but endured a bad night with increased fever. The
next two days passed in the same manner, the fever becoming worse
and worse; nevertheless Alexander still summoned Nearchus to his
bedside, discussed with him many points about his maritime projects,
and repeated his order that the fleet should be ready by the third
day. On the ensuing morning the fever was violent; Alexander reposed
all day in a bathing-house in the garden, yet still calling in the
generals to direct the filling up of vacancies among the officers,
and ordering that the armament should be ready to move. Throughout
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span> two next
days, his malady became hourly more aggravated. On the last day
of the two, Alexander could with difficulty support the being
lifted out of bed to perform the sacrifice; even then, however,
he continued to give orders to the generals about the expedition.
On the morrow, though desperately ill, he still made the effort
requisite for performing the sacrifice; he was then carried across
from the garden-house to the palace, giving orders that the generals
and officers should remain in permanent attendance in and near the
hall. He caused some of them to be called to his bedside; but though
he knew them perfectly, he had by this time become incapable of
utterance. One of his last words spoken is said to have been, on
being asked to whom he bequeathed his kingdom, “<i>To the strongest</i>;”
one of his last acts was, to take the signet ring from his finger,
and hand it to Perdikkas.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616"
class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>For two nights and a day he continued in this state, without
either amendment or repose. Meanwhile, the news of his malady had
spread through the army, filling them with grief and consternation.
Many of the soldiers, eager to see him once more, forced their way
into the palace, and were admitted unarmed. They passed along by the
bedside, with all the demonstrations of affliction and sympathy:
Alexander knew them, and made show of friendly recognition as well as
he could; but was unable to say a word. Several of the generals slept
in the temple of Serapis, hoping to be informed by the god in a dream
whether they ought to bring Alexander into it, as a suppliant to
experience the divine healing power. The god informed them in their
dream, that Alexander ought not to be brought into the temple—that
it would be better for him to be left where he was. In the afternoon
he expired—June 323 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—after a
life of thirty-two years and eight months—and a reign of twelve
years and eight months.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617"
class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span>The death of
Alexander, thus suddenly cut off by a fever in the plenitude of
health, vigor, and aspirations, was an event impressive as well as
important, in the highest possible degree, to his contemporaries
far and near. When the first report of it was brought to Athens,
the orator Demades exclaimed:—“It cannot be true: if Alexander were
dead, the whole habitable world would have smelt of his carcass.”<a
id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
This coarse but em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p.
258]</span>phatic comparison illustrates the immediate, powerful,
and wide-reaching impression produced by the sudden extinction of
the great conqueror. It was felt by each of the many remote envoys
who had so recently come to propitiate this far-shooting Apollo—by
every man among the nations who had sent these envoys—throughout
Europe, Asia, and Africa, as then known,—to affect either his
actual condition or his probable future.<a id="FNanchor_619"
href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> The first growth
and development of Macedonia, during the twenty-two years preceding
the battle of Chæroneia, from an embarrassed secondary State into
the first of all known powers, had excited the astonishment of
contemporaries, and admiration for Philip’s organizing genius.
But the achievements of Alexander, during his twelve years of
reign, throwing Philip into the shade, had been on a scale so much
grander and vaster, and so completely without serious reverse or
even interruption, as to transcend the measure, not only of human
expectation, but almost of human belief. The Great King (as the king
of Persia was called by excellence) was, and had long been, the type
of worldly power and felicity, even down to the time when Alexander
crossed the Hellespont. Within four years and three months from this
event, by one stupendous defeat after another, Darius had lost all
his Western Empire, and had become a fugitive eastward of the Caspian
Gates, escaping captivity at the hands of Alexander only to perish by
those of the satrap Bessus. All antecedent historical parallels—the
ruin and captivity of the Lydian Crœsus, the expulsion and mean
life of the Syracusan Dionysius, both of them impressive examples
of the mutability of human condition,—sank into trifles compared
with the overthrow of this towering Persian colossus. The orator
Æschines expressed the genuine sentiment of a Grecian spectator,
when he exclaimed (in a speech delivered at Athens shortly before
the death of Darius):—“What is there among the list of strange and
unexpected events, that has not occurred in our time? Our lives
have transcended the limits of humanity; we are born to serve as a
theme for incredible tales to posterity. Is not the Persian king—who
dug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span> through Athos
and bridged the Hellespont,—who demanded earth and water from the
Greeks,—who dared to proclaim himself, in public epistles, master
of all mankind from the rising to the setting sun—is not <i>he</i> now
struggling to the last, not for dominion over others, but for the
safety of his own person?”<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620"
class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>Such were the sentiments excited by Alexander’s career even in
the middle of 330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, more than
seven years before his death. During the following seven years,
his additional achievements had carried astonishment yet farther.
He had mastered, in defiance of fatigue, hardship, and combat, not
merely all the eastern half of the Persian empire, but unknown Indian
regions beyond its easternmost limits. Besides Macedonia, Greece,
and Thrace, he possessed all that immense treasure and military
force which had once rendered the Great King so formidable. By no
contemporary man had any such power ever been known or conceived.
With the turn of imagination then prevalent, many were doubtless
disposed to take him for a god on earth, as Grecian spectators
had once supposed with regard to Xerxes, when they beheld the
innumerable Persian host crossing the Hellespont.<a id="FNanchor_621"
href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>Exalted to this prodigious grandeur, Alexander was at the time
of his death little more than thirty-two years old—the age at
which a citizen of Athens was growing into important commands; ten
years less than the age for a consul at Rome;<a id="FNanchor_622"
href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> two years younger
than the age at which Timour first acquired the crown, and began
his foreign conquests.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623"
class="fnanchor">[623]</a> His extraordinary<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span> bodily powers were unabated; he
had acquired a large stock of military experience; and what was
still more important, his appetite for farther conquest was as
voracious, and his readiness to purchase it at the largest cost of
toil or danger, as complete, as it had been when he first crossed
the Hellespont. Great as his past career had been, his future
achievements, with such increased means and experience, were
likely to be yet greater. His ambition would have been satisfied
with nothing less than the conquest of the whole habitable
world as then known;<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624"
class="fnanchor">[624]</a> and if his life had been prolonged, he
would probably have accomplished it. Nowhere (so far as our knowledge
reaches) did there reside any military power capable of making head
against him; nor were his soldiers, when he commanded them, daunted
or baffled by any extremity of cold, heat, or fatigue. The patriotic
feelings of Livy dispose him to maintain<a id="FNanchor_625"
href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> that Alexander,
had he invaded Italy and assailed Romans or Samnites, would have
failed and perished like his relative Alexander of Epirus. But this
conclusion cannot be accepted. If we grant the courage and discipline
of the Roman infantry to have been equal to the best infantry of
Alexander’s army, the same cannot be said of the Roman cavalry as
compared with the Macedonian Companions. Still less is it likely
that a Roman consul, annually changed, would have been found a match
for Alexander in military genius and combinations; nor, even if
personally equal, would he have possessed the same variety of troops
and arms, each effective in its separate way, and all conspiring
to one common purpose—nor the same unbounded influence over their
minds in stimulating them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p.
261]</span> to full effort. I do not think that even the Romans could
have successfully resisted Alexander the Great; though it is certain
that he never throughout all his long marches encountered such
enemies as they, nor even such as Samnites and Lucanians—combining
courage, patriotism, discipline, with effective arms both for defence
and for close combat.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626"
class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>Among all the qualities which go to constitute the highest
military excellence, either as a general or as a soldier, none
was wanting in the character of Alexander. Together with his own
chivalrous courage—sometimes indeed both excessive and unseasonable,
so as to form the only military defect which can be fairly
imputed to him—we trace in all his operations the most careful
dispositions taken beforehand, vigilant precaution in guarding
against possible reverse, and abundant resource in adapting himself
to new contingences. Amidst constant success, these precautionary
combinations were never discontinued. His achievements are the
earliest recorded evidence of scientific military organization on
a large scale, and of its overwhelming effects. Alexander overawes
the imagination more than any other personage of antiquity, by the
matchless development of all that constitutes effective force—as an
individual warrior, and as organizer and leader of armed masses; not
merely the blind impetuosity ascribed by Homer to Ares, but also
the intelligent, methodized, and all-subduing compression which he
personifies in Athênê. But all his great qualities were fit for use
only against enemies; in which category indeed were numbered all
mankind, known and unknown, except those who chose to submit to
him. In his Indian campaigns, amidst tribes of utter strangers, we
perceive that not only those who stand on their defence, but also
those who abandon their property and flee to the mountains, are alike
pursued and slaughtered.</p>

<p>Apart from the transcendent merits of Alexander as a soldier and
a general, some authors give him credit for grand and bene<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span>ficent views on the
subject of imperial government, and for intentions highly favorable
to the improvement of mankind. I see no ground for adopting this
opinion. As far as we can venture to anticipate what would have
been Alexander’s future, we see nothing in prospect except years
of ever-repeated aggression and conquest, not to be concluded
until he had traversed and subjugated all the inhabited globe. The
acquisition of universal dominion—conceived not metaphorically,
but literally, and conceived with greater facility in consequence
of the imperfect geographical knowledge of the time—was the
master-passion of his soul. At the moment of his death, he was
commencing fresh aggression in the south against the Arabians, to
an indefinite extent;<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627"
class="fnanchor">[627]</a> while his vast projects against the
western tribes in Africa and Europe, as far as the pillars of
Herakles, were consigned in the orders and memoranda confidentially
communicated to Kraterus.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628"
class="fnanchor">[628]</a> Italy, Gaul, and Spain, would have been
successively attacked and conquered; the enterprises proposed to
him when in Baktria by the Chorasmian prince Pharasmanes, but
postponed then until a more convenient season, would have been
next taken up, and he would have marched from the Danube northward
round the Euxine and Palus Mæotis against the Scythians and the
tribes of Caucasus.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629"
class="fnanchor">[629]</a> There remained moreover the Asiatic
regions east of the Hyphasis, which his soldiers had refused to
enter upon, but which he certainly would have invaded at a future
opportunity, were it only to efface the poignant humiliation
of having been compelled to relinquish his proclaimed purpose.
Though this sounds like romance and hyperbole, it was nothing more
than the real insatiate aspiration of Alexander, who looked upon
every new acquisition mainly as a capital for acquiring more.<a
id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
“You are a man like all of us, Alexander<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span>—except that you abandon your home (said
the naked Indian to him<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631"
class="fnanchor">[631]</a>) like a meddlesome destroyer, to
invade the most distant regions; enduring hardship yourself, and
inflicting hardship upon others.” Now, how an empire thus boundless
and heterogeneous, such as no prince has ever yet realized, could
have been administered with any superior advantages to subjects—it
would be difficult to show. The mere task of acquiring and
maintaining—of keeping satraps and tribute-gatherers in authority
as well as in subordination—of suppressing resistances ever liable
to recur in regions distant by months of march<a id="FNanchor_632"
href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>—would occupy the
whole life of a world-conqueror, without leaving any leisure for the
improvements suited to peace and stability, if we give him credit for
such purposes in theory.</p>

<p>But even this last is more than can be granted. Alexander’s
acts indicate that he desired nothing better than to take up
the traditions of the Persian empire; a tribute-levying and
army-levying system, under Macedonians, in large proportion, as
his instruments; yet partly also under the very same Persians who
had administered before, provided they submitted to him. It has
indeed been extolled among his merits that he was thus willing to
re-appoint Persian grandees (putting their armed force however
under the command of a Macedonian officer)—and to continue native
princes in their dominions, if they did willing homage to him, as
tributary subordinates. But all this had been done before him by the
Persian kings, whose system it was to leave the conquered princes
undisturbed, subject only to the payment of tribute, and to the
obligation of furnishing a military contingent when required.<a
id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
In like manner Alexander’s Asiatic empire would thus have been
composed of an aggregate of satrapies and dependent principalities,
furnishing money and sol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p.
264]</span>diers; in other respects, left to the discretion of
local rule, with occasional extreme inflictions of punishment,
but no systematic examination or control.<a id="FNanchor_634"
href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Upon this, the
condition of Asiatic empire in all ages, Alexander would have
grafted one special improvement: the military organization of the
empire, feeble under the Achæmenid princes, would have been greatly
strengthened by his genius, and by the able officers formed in
his school, both for foreign aggression and for home control.<a
id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p>The Persian empire was a miscellaneous aggregate, with no strong
feeling of nationality. The Macedonian conqueror who seized its
throne was still more indifferent to national sentiment. He was
neither Macedonian nor Greek. Though the absence of this prejudice
has sometimes been mounted to him as a virtue, it only made room, in
my opinion, for prejudices yet worse. The substitute for it was an
exorbitant personality and self-estimation, manifested even in his
earliest years, and inflamed by extraordinary success into the belief
in divine parentage; which, while setting him above the idea of
communion with any special nationality, made him conceive all mankind
as subjects under one common sceptre to be wielded by himself. To
this universal empire the Persian king made the nearest approach,<a
id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
according to the opinions then prevalent. Accordingly Alexander, when
victorious, accepted the position and pretensions of the overthrown
Persian court as approaching most nearly to his full due. He became
more Persian than either Macedonian or Greek. While himself adopting,
as far as he could safely venture, the personal habits of the Persian
court, he took studied pains to transform his Macedonian officers
into Persian grandees, encouraging and even forcing intermarriages
with Persian women according to Persian rites. At the time of
Alexander’s death, there was comprised, in his written orders given
to Kraterus, a plan for the wholesale transportation of inhabitants,
both out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span>
Europe into Asia, and out of Asia into Europe, in order to fuse these
populations into one by multiplying intermarriages and intercourse.<a
id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
Such reciprocal translation of peoples would have been felt as
eminently odious, and could not have been accomplished without
coercive authority.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638"
class="fnanchor">[638]</a> It is rash to speculate upon unexecuted
purposes; but, as far as we can judge, such compulsory mingling of
the different races promises nothing favorable to the happiness of
any of them, though it might serve as an imposing novelty and memento
of imperial omnipotence.</p>

<p>In respect of intelligence and combining genius, Alexander
was Hellenic to the full; in respect of disposition and purpose,
no one could be less Hellenic. The acts attesting his Oriental
violence of impulse, unmeasured self-will,<a id="FNanchor_639"
href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> and exaction of
reverence above the limits of humanity—have been already recounted.
To describe him as a son of Hellas, imbued with the political
maxims of Aristotle, and bent on the systematic diffusion of
Hellenic culture for the improvement of mankind<a id="FNanchor_640"
href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>—is, in my<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span> judgment, an estimate
of his character contrary to the evidence. Alexander is indeed
said to have invited suggestions from Aristotle as to the best
mode of colonizing; but his temper altered so much, after a few
years of Asiatic conquest, that he came not only to lose all
deference for Aristotle’s advice, but even to hate him bitterly.<a
id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
Moreover, though the philosopher’s full suggestions have not been
preserved, yet we are told generally that he recommended Alexander to
behave to the Greeks as a leader or president, or limited chief—and
to the Barbarians (non-Hellenes) as a master;<a id="FNanchor_642"
href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> a distinction
substantially coinciding with that pointed out by Burke in his
speeches at the beginning of the American war, between the principles
of government proper to be followed by England in the American
colonies, and in British India. No Greek thinker believed the
Asiatics to be capable of that free civil polity<a id="FNanchor_643"
href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> upon which the march
of every Gre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span>cian
community was based. Aristotle did not wish to degrade the Asiatics
below the level to which they had been accustomed, but rather to
preserve the Greeks from being degraded to the same level. Now
Alexander recognized no such distinction as that drawn by his
preceptor. He treated Greeks and Asiatics alike, not by elevating
the latter, but by degrading the former. Though he employed all
indiscriminately as instruments, yet he presently found the free
speech of Greeks, and even of Macedonians, so distasteful and
offensive, that his preferences turned more and more in favor of
the servile Asiatic sentiment and customs. Instead of hellenizing
Asia, he was tending to asiatize Macedonia and Hellas. His temper
and character, as modified by a few years of conquest, rendered him
quite unfit to follow the course recommended by Aristotle towards the
Greeks—quite as unfit as any of the Persian kings, or as the French
Emperor Napoleon, to endure that partial frustration, compromise, and
smart from free criticism, which is inseparable from the position of
a limited chief. Among a multitude of subjects more diverse-colored
than even the army of Xerxes, it is quite possible that he might have
turned his power towards the improvement of the rudest portions.
We are told (though the fact is difficult to credit, from his want
of time) that he abolished various barbarisms of the Hyrkanians,
Arachosians, and Sogdians.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644"
class="fnanchor">[644]</a> But Macedonians as well as Greeks would
have been pure losers by being absorbed into an immense Asiatic
aggregate.</p>

<p>Plutarch states that Alexander founded more than seventy
new cities in Asia.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645"
class="fnanchor">[645]</a> So large a number of them is neither
veri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span>fiable nor
probable, unless we either reckon up simple military posts, or borrow
from the list of foundations really established by his successors.
Except Alexandria in Egypt, none of the cities founded by Alexander
himself can be shown to have attained any great development. Nearly
all were planted among the remote, warlike, and turbulent peoples
eastward of the Caspian Gates. Such establishments were really
fortified posts to hold the country in subjection: Alexander lodged
in them detachments from his army; but none of these detachments
can well have been large, since he could not afford materially to
weaken his army, while active military operations were still going
on and while farther advance was in contemplation. More of these
settlements were founded in Sogdiana than elsewhere; but respecting
the Sogdian foundations, we know that the Greeks whom he established
there, chained to the spot only by fear of his power, broke away in
mutiny immediately on the news of his death.<a id="FNanchor_646"
href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Some Greek
soldiers in Alexander’s army on the Jaxartes or the Hydaspes,
sick and weary of his interminable marches, might prefer being
enrolled among the colonists of a new city on one of these unknown
rivers, to the ever-repeated routine of ex<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span>hausting duty.<a id="FNanchor_647"
href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> But it is certain
that no volunteer emigrants would go forth to settle at distances
such as their imaginations could hardly conceive. The absorbing
appetite of Alexander was conquest, to the East, West, South, and
North; the cities which he planted were established, for the most
part, as garrisons to maintain his most distant and most precarious
acquisitions. The purpose of colonization was altogether subordinate;
and that of hellenizing Asia, so far as we can see, was not even
contemplated, much less realized.</p>

<p>This process of hellenizing Asia—in so far as Asia was ever
hellenized—which has often been ascribed to Alexander, was in
reality the work of the Diadochi who came after him; though his
conquests doubtless opened the door and established the military
ascendency which rendered such a work practicable. The position, the
aspirations, and the interests of these Diadochi—Antigonus, Ptolemy,
Seleukus, Lysimachus, etc.—were materially different from those of
Alexander. They had neither appetite nor means for new and remote
conquest; their great rivalry was with each other; each sought to
strengthen himself near home against the rest. It became a matter
of fashion and pride with them, not less than of interest, to found
new cities immortalizing their family names. These foundations
were chiefly made in the regions of Asia near and known to Greeks,
where Alexander had planted none. Thus the great and numerous
foundations of Seleukus Nikator and his successors covered Syria,
Mesopotamia, and parts of Asia Minor. All these regions were known
to Greeks, and more or less tempting to new Grecian immigrants—not
out of reach or hearing of the Olympic and other festivals, as the
Jaxartes and the Indus were. In this way a considerable influx of new
hellenic blood was poured into Asia during the century succeeding
Alexander,—probably in great measure from Italy and Sicily, where the
condition of the Greek cities became still more calamitous—besides
the numerous Greeks who took service as individuals under
these Asiatic kings. Greeks, and Macedonians speaking Greek,
became predominant, if not in numbers,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span> at least in importance, throughout
most of the cities in Western Asia. In particular, the Macedonian
military organization, discipline, and administration, was maintained
systematically among these Asiatic kings. In the account of the
battle of Magnesia, fought by the Seleukid king Atiochus the Great
against the Romans in 190 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the
Macedonian phalanx, constituting the main force of his Asiatic army,
appears in all its completeness, just as it stood under Philip and
Perseus in Macedonia itself.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648"
class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>When it is said however that Asia became hellenized under
Alexander’s successors, the phrase requires explanation.
Hellenism, properly so called—the aggregate of habits, sentiments,
energies, and intelligence, manifested by the Greeks during
their epoch of autonomy<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649"
class="fnanchor">[649]</a>—never passed over into Asia; neither
the highest qualities of the Greek mind, not even the entire
character of ordinary Greeks. This genuine Hellenism could not
subsist under the overruling compression of Alexander, nor even
under the less irresistible pressure of his successors. Its living
force, productive genius, self-organizing power, and active spirit
of political communion, were stifled, and gradually died out. All
that passed into Asia was a faint and partial resemblance of it,
carrying the superficial marks of the original. The administration of
the Greco-Asiatic kings was not hellenic (as it has been sometimes
called), but completely despotic, as that of the Persians had been
before. Whoever follows their history, until the period of Roman
dominion, will see that it turned upon the tastes, temper, and
ability of the prince, and on the circumstances of the regal family.
Viewing their government as a system, its promi<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span>nent difference as compared with
their Persian predecessors, consisted in their retaining the
military traditions and organization of Philip and Alexander, an
elaborate scheme of discipline and manœuvring, which would not be
kept up without permanent official grades and a higher measure of
intelligence than had ever been displayed under the Achæmenid kings,
who had no military school or training whatever. Hence a great number
of individual Greeks found employment in the military as well as
in the civil service of these Greco-Asiatic kings. The intelligent
Greek, instead of a citizen of Hellas, became the instrument of a
foreign prince; the details of government were managed to a great
degree by Greek officials, and always in the Greek language.</p>

<p>Moreover, besides this, there was the still more important fact
of the many new cities founded in Asia by the Seleukidæ and the
other contemporary kings. Each of these cities had a considerable
infusion of Greek and Macedonian citizens, among the native Orientals
located there, often brought by compulsion from neighboring villages.
In what numerical ratio these two elements of the civic population
stood to each other, we cannot say. But the Greeks and Macedonians
were the leading and active portion, who exercised the greatest
assimilating force, gave imposing effect to the public manifestations
of religion, had wider views and sympathies, dealt with the central
government, and carried on that contracted measure of municipal
autonomy which the city was permitted to retain. In these cities the
Greek inhabitants, though debarred from political freedom, enjoyed
a range of social activity suited to their tastes. In each, Greek
was the language of public business and dealing; each formed a
centre of attraction and commerce for an extensive neighborhood; all
together, they were the main hellenic or quasi-hellenic element in
Asia under the Greco-Asiatic kings, as contrasted with the rustic
villages, where native manners, and probably native speech, still
continued with little modification. But the Greeks of Antioch, or
Alexandria, or Seleukeia, were not like citizens of Athens or Thebes,
nor even like men of Tarentum or Ephesus. While they communicated
their language to Orientals, they became themselves substantially
orientalized. Their feelings, judgments, and habits of action, ceased
to be hellenic. Polybius,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p.
272]</span> when he visited Alexandria, looked with surprise and
aversion on the Greeks there resident, though they were superior
to the non-hellenic population, whom he considered worthless.<a
id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
Greek social habits, festivals, and legends, passed with the hellenic
settlers into Asia; all becoming amalgamated and transformed so as to
suit a new Asiatic abode. Important social and political consequences
turned upon the diffusion of the language, and upon the establishment
of such a common medium of communication throughout Western Asia.
But after all, the hellenized Asiatic was not so much a Greek as a
foreigner with Grecian speech, exterior varnish, and superficial
manifestations; distinguished fundamentally from those Greek citizens
with whom the present history has been concerned. So he would have
been considered by Sophokles, by Thucydides, by Sokrates.</p>

<p>Thus much is necessary in order to understand the bearing of
Alexander’s conquests, not only upon the hellenic population, but
upon hellenic attributes and peculiarities. While crushing the Greeks
as communities at home, these conquests opened a wider range to the
Greeks as individuals abroad; and produced—perhaps the best of all
their effects—a great increase of intercommunication, multiplication
of roads, extension of commercial dealing, and enlarged facilities
for the acquisition of geographical knowledge. There already existed
in the Persian empire an easy and convenient royal road (established
by Darius son of Hystaspes and described as well as admired by
Herodotus) for the three months’ journey between Sardis and Susa;
and there must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span>
have been another regular road from Susa and Ekbatana to Baktria,
Sogdiana, and India. Alexander, had he lived, would doubtless have
multiplied on a still larger scale the communications both by sea
and land between the various parts of his world-empire. We read
that among the gigantic projects which he was contemplating when
surprised by death, one was, the construction of a road all along
the northern coast of Africa, as far as the Pillars of Herakles.<a
id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> He
had intended to found a new maritime city on the Persian Gulf, at the
mouth of the Euphrates, and to incur much outlay for regulating the
flow of water in its lower course. The river would probably have been
thus made again to afford the same conveniences, both for navigation
and irrigation, as it appears to have furnished in earlier times
under the ancient Babylonian kings. Orders had been also given for
constructing a fleet to explore the Caspian Sea. Alexander believed
that sea to be connected with the Eastern Ocean,<a id="FNanchor_652"
href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> and intended to make
it his point of departure for circumnavigating the eastern limits
of Asia, which country yet remained for him to conquer. The voyage
already performed by Nearchus, from the mouth of the Indus to that
of the Euphrates, was in those days a splendid maritime achievement;
to which another still greater was on the point of being added—the
circumnavigation of Arabia from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea;
though here we must remark, that this same voyage (from the mouth
of the Indus round Arabia into the Red Sea) had been performed in
thirty months, a century and a half before, by Skylax of Karyanda,
under the orders of Darius son of Hystaspes;<a id="FNanchor_653"
href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> yet, though re<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span>corded by Herodotus,
forgotten (as it would appear) by Alexander and his contemporaries.
This enlarged and systematic exploration of the earth, combined with
increased means of communication among its inhabitants, is the main
feature in Alexander’s career which presents itself as promising real
consequences beneficial to humanity.</p>

<p>We read that Alexander felt so much interest in the extension of
science, that he gave to Aristotle the immense sum of 800 talents in
money, placing under his directions several thousand men, for the
purpose of prosecuting zoological researches.<a id="FNanchor_654"
href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> These exaggerations
are probably the work of those enemies of the philosopher who decried
him as a pensioner of the Macedonian court; but it is probable enough
that Philip, and Alexander in the early part of his reign, may have
helped Aristotle in the difficult process of getting together facts
and specimens for observation—from esteem towards him personally,
rather than from interest in his discoveries. The intellectual turn
of Alexander was towards literature, poetry, and history. He was fond
of the Iliad especially, as well as of the Attic tragedians; so that
Harpalus, being directed to send some books to him in Upper Asia,
selected as the most acceptable packet various tragedies of Æschylus,
Sophokles, and Euripides, with the dithyrambic poems of Telestes and
the histories of Phlistus.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655"

    GRECIAN AFFAIRS FROM THE LANDING OF ALEXANDER IN ASIA
    TO THE CLOSE OF THE LAMIAN WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Even</span> in 334
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, when Alexander first entered upon his
Asiatic campaigns, the Grecian cities, great as well as small,
had been robbed of all their free agency, and existed only as
appendages of the kingdom of Macedonia. Several of them were
occupied by Macedonian garrisons, or governed by local despots who
leaned upon such armed force for support. There existed among them
no common idea or public sentiment, formally proclaimed and acted
on, except such as it suited Alexander’s purpose to encourage.
The miso-Persian sentiment—once a genuine expression of Hellenic
patriotism, to the recollection of which Demosthenes was wont to
appeal, in animating the Athenians to action against Macedonia,
but now extinct and supplanted by nearer apprehensions—had been
converted by Alexander to his own purposes, as a pretext for
headship, and a help for ensuring submission during his absence
in Asia. Greece had become a province of Macedonia; the affairs
of the Greeks (observes Aristotle in illustrating a philosophical
discussion) are “in the hands of the king.”<a id="FNanchor_656"
href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> A public synod of
the Greeks sat from time to time at Corinth; but it represented only
philo-Macedonian sentiment; all that we know of its proceedings
consisted in congratulations to Alexander on his victories. There is
no Grecian history of public or political import; there are no facts
except the local and municipal details of each city—“the streets
and fountains which we are repairing and the battlements which we
are whitening”, to use a phrase of Demosthenes<a id="FNanchor_657"
href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>—the good management
of the Athenian finances by the orator<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span> Lykurgus, and the contentions of
orators respecting private disputes or politics of the past.</p>

<p>But though Grecian history is thus stagnant and suspended
during the first years of Alexander’s Asiatic campaigns, it might
at any moment have become animated with an active spirit of
self-emancipation, if he had experienced reverses, or if the Persians
had administered their own affairs with skill and vigor. I have
already stated, that during the first two years of the war, the
Persian fleet (we ought rather to say, the Phenician fleet in the
Persian service) had a decided superiority at sea. Darius possessed
untold treasures which might have indefinitely increased that
superiority and multiplied his means of transmarine action, had he
chosen to follow the advice of Memnon, by acting vigorously from the
sea and strictly on the defensive by land. The movement or quiescence
of the Greeks therefore depended on the turn of affairs in Asia; as
Alexander himself was well aware.</p>

<p>During the winter of 334-333 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Memnon
with the Persian fleet appeared to be making progress among the
islands in the Ægean,<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658"
class="fnanchor">[658]</a> and the anti-Macedonian Greeks were
expecting him farther westward in Eubœa and Peloponnesus. Their hopes
being dashed by his unexpected death, and still more by Darius’s
abandonment of the Memnonian plans, they had next to wait for the
chance of what might be achieved by the immense Persian land-force.
Even down to the eve of the battle of Issus, Demosthenes<a
id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
and others (as has already been mentioned) were encouraged by their
correspondents in Asia to anticipate success for Darius even in
pitched battle. But after the great disaster at Issus, during a
year and a half (from November 333 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> to
March or April 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), no hope was possible.
The Persian force seemed extinct, and Darius was so paralyzed by
the captivity of his family, that he suffered even the citizens
of Tyre and Gaza to perish in their gallant efforts of defence,
without the least effort to save them. At length, in the spring
of 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the prospects again appeared
to improve. A second Persian army, countless like the first, was
assembling eastward of the Tigris; Alexander ad<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span>vanced into the interior, many weeks’
march from the shores of the Mediterranean, to attack them; and
the Persians doubtless transmitted encouragements with money
to enterprising men in Greece, in hopes of provoking auxiliary
movements. Presently (October 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) came the
catastrophe at Arbela; after which no demonstration against Alexander
could have been attempted with any reasonable hope of success.</p>

<p>Such was the varying point of view under which the contest in
Asia presented itself to Grecian spectators, during the three years
and a half between the landing of Alexander in Asia and the battle
of Arbela. As to the leading states in Greece, we have to look at
Athens and Sparta only; for Thebes had been destroyed and demolished
as a city; and what had been once the citadel of the Kadmeia was
now a Macedonian garrison.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660"
class="fnanchor">[660]</a> Moreover, besides that garrison, the
Bœotian cities, Orchomenus, Platæa, etc., were themselves strongholds
of Macedonian dependence; being hostile to Thebes of old, and having
received among themselves assignments of all the Theban lands.<a
id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> In
case of any movement in Greece, therefore, Antipater, the viceroy of
Macedonia, might fairly count on finding in Greece interested allies,
serving as no mean check upon Attica.</p>

<p>At Athens, the reigning sentiment was decidedly pacific. Few
were disposed to brave the prince who had just given so fearful
an evidence of his force by the destruction of Thebes and the
enslavement of the Thebans. Ephialtes and Charidemus, the military
citizens at Athens most anti-Macedonian in sentiment, had been
demanded as prisoners by Alexander, and had withdrawn to Asia, there
to take service with Darius. Other Athenians, men of energy and
action, had followed their example, and had fought against Alexander
at the Granikus, where they became his prisoners, and were sent
to Macedonia to work in fetters at the mines. Ephialtes perished
at the siege of Halikarnassus, while defending the place with the
utmost gallantry; Charidemus suffered a more unworthy death from the
shameful sentence of Darius. The anti-Macedonian leaders who remained
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span> Athens, such
as Demosthenes and Lykurgus, were not generals or men of action,
but statesmen and orators. They were fully aware that submission to
Alexander was a painful necessity, though they watched not the less
anxiously for any reverse which might happen to him, such as to make
it possible for Athens to head a new struggle on behalf of Grecian
freedom.</p>

<p>But it was not Demosthenes nor Lykurgus who now guided the
general policy of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662"
class="fnanchor">[662]</a> For the twelve years between the
destruction of Thebes and the death of Alexander, Phokion and Demades
were her ministers for foreign affairs; two men of totally opposite
characters, but coinciding in pacific views, and in looking to the
favor of Alexander and Antipater as the principal end to be attained.
Twenty Athenian triremes were sent to act with the Macedonian fleet,
during Alexander’s first campaign in Asia; these, together with the
Athenian prisoners taken at the Granikus, served to him farther as a
guarantee for the continued submission of the Athenians generally.<a
id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
There can be no doubt that the pacific policy of Phokion was now
prudent and essential to Athens, though the same cannot be said
(as I have remarked in the proper place) for his advocacy of the
like policy twenty years before, when Philip’s power was growing
and might have been arrested by vigorous opposition. It suited the
purpose of Antipater to ensure his hold upon Athens by frequent
presents to Demades, a man of luxurious and extravagant habits. But
Phokion, incorruptible as well as poor to the end, declined all
similar offers, though often made to him, not only by Antipater,
but even by Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664"
class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>It deserves particular notice, that though the macedonizing policy
was now decidedly in the ascendent—accepted, even by dissentients,
as the only course admissible under the circumstances, and confirmed
the more by each successive victory of Alexander—yet statesmen, like
Lykurgus and Demosthenes, of notorious anti-Macedonian sentiment,
still held a conspicuous and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p.
279]</span> influential position, though of course restricted to
matters of internal administration. Thus Lykurgus continued to be the
real acting minister of finance, for three successive Panathenaic
intervals of four years each, or for an uninterrupted period of
twelve years. He superintended not merely the entire collection,
but also the entire disbursement of the public revenue; rendering
strict periodical account, yet with a financial authority greater
than had belonged to any statesman since Perikles. He improved the
gymnasia and stadia of the city—multiplied the donatives and sacred
furniture in the temples—enlarged, or constructed anew, docks and
arsenals,—provided a considerable stock of arms and equipments,
military as well as naval—and maintained four hundred triremes in
a seaworthy condition, for the protection of Athenian commerce.
In these extensive functions he was never superseded, though
Alexander at one time sent to require the surrender of his person,
which was refused by the Athenian people.<a id="FNanchor_665"
href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The main cause of
his firm hold upon the public mind, was, his known and indisputable
pecuniary probity, wherein he was the parallel of Phokion.</p>

<p>As to Demosthenes, he did not hold any such commanding public
appointments as Lykurgus; but he enjoyed great esteem and
sympathy from the people generally, for his marked line of public
counsel during the past. The proof of this is to be found<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span> in one very significant
fact. The indictment, against Ktesiphon’s motion for crowning
Demosthenes, was instituted by Æschines, and official entry made
of it, before the death of Philip—which event occurred in August
336 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Yet Æschines did not venture to bring
it on for trial until August 330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, after
Antipater had subdued the ill-fated rising of the Lacedæmonian king
Agis; and even at that advantageous moment, when the macedonizers
seemed in full triumph, he signally failed. We thus perceive, that
though Phokion and Demades were now the leaders of Athenian affairs,
as representing a policy which every one felt to be unavoidable—yet
the preponderant sentiment of the people went with Demosthenes
and Lykurgus. In fact, we shall see that after the Lamian war,
Antipater thought it requisite to subdue or punish this sentiment
by disfranchising or deporting two-thirds of the citizens.<a
id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
It seems however that the anti-Macedonian statesmen were very
cautious of giving offence to Alexander, between 334 and 330
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Ktesiphon accepted a mission of condolence
to Kleopatra, sister of Alexander, on the death of her husband
Alexander of Epirus; and Demosthenes stands accused of having sent
humble and crouching letters to Alexander (the Great) in Phenicia,
during the spring of 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> This assertion of
Æschines, though not to be trusted as correct, indicates the general
prudence of Demosthenes as to his known and formidable enemy.<a
id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span>It was not
from Athens, but from Sparta, that anti-Macedonian movements now took
rise.</p>

<p>In the decisive battle unsuccessfully fought by Athens and Thebes
at Chæroneia against Philip, the Spartans had not been concerned.
Their king Archidamus,—who had been active conjointly with Athens
in the Sacred War, trying to uphold the Phokians against Philip and
the Thebans,—had afterwards withdrawn himself from Central Greece
to assist the Tarentines in Italy, and had been slain in a battle
against the Messapians.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668"
class="fnanchor">[668]</a> He was succeeded by his son Agis, a brave
and enterprising man, under whom the Spartans, though abstaining
from hostilities against Philip, resolutely declined to take part in
the synod at Corinth, whereby the Macedonian prince was nominated
Leader of the Greeks; and even persisted in the same denial on
Alexander’s nomination also. When Alexander sent to Athens three
hundred panoplies after his victory at the Granikus, to be dedicated
in the temple of Athênê, he expressly proclaimed in the inscription,
that they were dedicated “by Alexander and the Greeks, <i>excepting
the Lacedæmonians</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669"
class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Agis took the lead in trying to procure
Persian aid for anti-Macedonian operations in Greece. Towards the
close of summer 333 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, a little before
the battle of Issus, he visited the Persian admirals at Chios,
to solicit men and money for intended action in Peloponnesus.<a
id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
At that moment, they were not zealous in the direction of Greece,
anticipating (as most Asiatics then did) the complete destruction
of Alexander in Kilikia. As soon, however, as the disaster of Issus
became known, they placed at the disposal of Agis thirty talents and
ten triremes; which he employed, under his brother Agesilaus, in
making himself master of Krete—feeling that no movement in Greece
could be expected at such a discouraging crisis. Agis himself
soon afterwards went to that island, having<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span> strengthened himself by a division of
the Greek mercenaries who had fought under Darius at Issus. In Krete,
he appears to have had considerable temporary success; and even in
Peloponnesus, he organized some demonstrations, which Alexander sent
Amphoterus with a large naval force to repress, in the spring of 331
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671"
class="fnanchor">[671]</a> At that time, Phenicia, Egypt, and all
the naval mastery of the Ægean, had passed into the hands of the
conqueror, so that the Persians had no direct means of acting upon
Greece. Probably Amphoterus recovered Krete, but he had no land-force
to attack Agis in Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>In October 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Darius was beaten at
Arbela and became a fugitive in Media, leaving Babylon, Susa, and
Persepolis, with the bulk of his immense treasures, as a prey to the
conqueror during the coming winter. After such prodigious accessions
to Alexander’s force, it would seem that any anti-Macedonian
movement, during the spring of 330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, must
have been obviously hopeless and even insane. Yet it was just then
that King Agis found means to enlarge his scale of operations in
Peloponnesus, and prevailed on a considerable body of new allies
to join him. As to himself personally, he and the Lacedæmonians
had been previously in a state of proclaimed war with Macedonia,<a
id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
and therefore incurred little additional risk; moreover, it<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span> was one of the effects
of the Asiatic disasters to cast back upon Greece small hands of
soldiers who had hitherto found service in the Persian armies.
These men willingly came to Cape Tænarus to enlist under a warlike
king of Sparta; so that Agis found himself at the head of a force
which appeared considerable to Peloponnesians, familiar only with
the narrow scale of Grecian war-muster, though insignificant as
against Alexander or his viceroy in Macedonia.<a id="FNanchor_673"
href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> An unexpected ray of
hope broke out from the revolt of Memnon, the Macedonian governor
of Thrace. Antipater was thus compelled to withdraw some of his
forces to a considerable distance from Greece; while Alexander,
victorious as he was, being in Persis or Media, east of Mount Zagros,
appeared in the eyes of a Greek to have reached the utmost limits
of the habitable world.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674"
class="fnanchor">[674]</a> Of this partial encouragement Agis took
advantage, to march out of Lakonia with all the troops, mercenary
and native, that he could muster. He called on the Peloponnesians
for a last effort against Macedonian dominion, while Darius still
retained all the eastern half of his empire, and while support from
him in men and money might yet be anticipated.<a id="FNanchor_675"
href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>Respecting this war, we know very few details. At first, a flush
of success appeared in attend Agis. The Eleians, the Achæans (except
Pellênê), the Arcadians (except Megalopolis)<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_284">[p. 284]</span> and some other Peloponnesians, joined
his standard; so that he was enabled to collect an army stated at
20,000 foot and 2000 horse. Defeating the first Macedonian forces
sent against him, he proceeded to lay siege to Megalopolis; which
city, now as previously, was the stronghold of Macedonian influence
in the peninsula, and was probably occupied by a Macedonian
garrison. An impulse manifested itself at Athens in favor of active
sympathy, and equipment of a fleet to aid this anti-Macedonian
effort. It was resisted by Phokion and Demades, doubtless upon
all views of prudence, but especially upon one financial ground,
taken by the latter, that the people would be compelled to forego
the Theoric distribution.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676"
class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Even Demosthenes himself, under
circumstances so obviously discouraging, could not recommend the
formidable step of declaring against Alexander—though he seems
to have indulged in the expression of general anti-Macedonian
sympathies, and to have complained of the helplessness into which
Athens had been brought by past bad policy.<a id="FNanchor_677"
href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Antipater, closing
the war in Thrace on the best terms that he could, hastened into
Greece with his full forces, and reached Peloponnesus in time to
relieve Megalopolis, which had begun to be in danger. One decisive
battle, which took place in Arcadia, sufficed to terminate the
war. Agis and his army, the Lacedæmonians especially, fought with
gallantry and desperation, but were completely defeated. Five
thousand of their men were slain, including Agis himself; who,
though covered with wounds, disdained to leave the field, and fell
resisting to the last. The victors, according to one account, lost
3500 men; according to another, 1000 slain, together with a great
many wounded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span>
This was a greater loss than Alexander had sustained either at Issus
or at Arbela; a plain proof that Agis and his companions, however
unfortunate in the result, had manifested courage worthy of the best
days of Sparta.</p>

<p>The allied forces were now so completely crushed, that all
submitted to Antipater. After consulting the philo-Macedonian synod
at Corinth, he condemned the Achæans and Eleians to pay 120 talents
to Megalopolis, and exacted from the Tegeans the punishment of those
among their leading men who had advised the war.<a id="FNanchor_678"
href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> But he would not
take upon him to determine the treatment of the Lacedæmonians,
without special reference to Alexander. Requiring from them fifty
hostages, he sent up to Alexander in Asia some Lacedæmonian envoys
or prisoners, to throw themselves on his mercy.<a id="FNanchor_679"
href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> We are told that they
did not reach the king until a long time afterwards, at Baktra;<a
id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
what he decided about Sparta generally, we do not know.</p>

<p>The rising of the Thebans, not many months after Alexander’s
accession, had been the first attempt of the Greeks to emancipate
themselves from Macedonian dominion; this enterprise of Agis was the
second. Both unfortunately had been partial, without the possibility
of any extensive or organized combination beforehand; both ended
miserably, riveting the chains of Greece more powerfully than ever.
Thus was the self-defensive force of Greece extinguished piecemeal.
The scheme of Agis was in fact desperate from the very outset, as
against the gigantic power of Alexander; and would perhaps never have
been undertaken, had not Agis himself been already compromised in
hostility against Macedonia, before the destruction of the Persian
force at Issus. This unfortunate prince, without any superior ability
(so far as we know), manifested a devoted courage and patriotism
worthy of his predecessor Leonidas at Thermopylæ; whose renown
stands higher, only because the cause in which he fell ultimately
triumphed. The Athenians and Ætolians, neither<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span> of whom took part with Agis, were now
left, without Thebes and Sparta, as the two great military powers of
Greece which will appear presently, when we come to the last struggle
for Grecian independence—the Lamian war; better combined and more
promising, yet not less disastrous in its result.</p>

<p>Though the strongest considerations of prudence kept Athens quiet
during this anti-Macedonian movement in Peloponnesus, a powerful
sympathy must have been raised among her citizens while the struggle
was going on. Had Agis gained the victory over Antipater, the
Athenians might probably have declared in his favor; and although no
independent position could have been permanently maintained against
so overwhelming an enemy as Alexander, yet considering that he was
thoroughly occupied and far in the interior of Asia, Greece might
have held out against Antipater for an interval not inconsiderable.
In the face of such eventualities, the fears of the macedonizing
statesmen now in power at Athens, the hopes of their opponents,
and the reciprocal antipathies of both, must have become unusually
manifest; so that the reaction afterwards, when the Macedonian power
became more irresistible than ever, was considered by the enemies
of Demosthenes to offer a favorable opportunity for ruining and
dishonoring him.</p>

<p>To the political peculiarity of this juncture we owe the judicial
contest between the two great Athenian orators; the memorable
accusation of Æschines against Ktesiphon, for having proposed a crown
to Demosthenes—and the still more memorable defence of Demosthenes,
on behalf of his friend as well as of himself. It was in the autumn
or winter of 337-336 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that Ktesiphon had
proposed this vote of public honor in favor of Demosthenes, and had
obtained the probouleuma or preliminary acquiescence of the senate;
it was in the same Attic year, and not long afterwards, that Æschines
attacked the proposition under the Graphê Paranomôn, as illegal,
unconstitutional, mischievous, and founded on false allegations.<a
id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>
More than six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span>
years had thus elapsed since the formal entry of the accusation;
yet Æschines had not chosen to bring it to actual trial; which
indeed could not be done without some risk to himself, before the
numerous and popular judicature of Athens. Twice or thrice before
his accusation was entered, other persons had moved to confer the
same honor upon Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682"
class="fnanchor">[682]</a> and had been indicted under the Graphê
Paranomôn; but with such signal ill-success, that their accusers did
not obtain so much as one-fifth of the suffrages of the Dikasts,
and therefore incurred (under the standing regulation of the Attic
law) a penalty of 1000 drachmæ. The like danger awaited Æschines;
and although, in reference to the illegality of Ktesiphon’s motion
(which was the direct and ostensible purpose aimed at under the
Graphê Paranomôn), his indictment was grounded on special<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span> circumstances such
as the previous accusers may not have been able to show, still it
was not his real object to confine himself within this narrow and
technical argument. He intended to enlarge the range of accusation,
so as to include the whole character and policy of Demosthenes;
who would thus, if the verdict went against him, stand publicly
dishonored both as citizen and as politician. Unless this latter
purpose were accomplished, indeed, Æschines gained nothing by
bringing the indictment into court; for the mere entry of the
indictment would have already produced the effect of preventing the
probouleuma from passing into a decree, and the crown from being
actually conferred. Doubtless Ktesiphon and Demosthenes might have
forced Æschines to the alternative of either dropping his indictment
or bringing it into the Dikastery. But this was a forward challenge,
which, in reference to a purely honorary vote, they had not felt
bold enough to send; especially after the capture of Thebes in 335
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> when the victorious Alexander demanded the
surrender of Demosthenes with several other citizens.</p>

<p>In this state of abeyance and compromise—Demosthenes enjoying
the inchoate honor of a complimentary vote from the senate,
Æschines intercepting it from being matured into a vote of the
people—both the vote and the indictment had remained for rather
more than six years. But the accuser now felt encouraged to push
his indictment to trial, under the reactionary party feeling,
following on abortive anti-Macedonian hopes, which succeeded to the
complete victory of Antipater over Agis, and which brought about
the accusation of anti-Macedonian citizens in Naxos, Thasos, and
other Grecian cities also.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683"
class="fnanchor">[683]</a> Amidst the fears prevalent that the
victor would carry his resentment still farther, Æschines could now
urge that Athens was disgraced by having adopted or even approved
the policy of Demosthenes,<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684"
class="fnanchor">[684]</a> and that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span> an emphatic condemnation of him was the
only way of clearing her from the charge of privity with those who
had raised the standard against Macedonian supremacy. In an able and
bitter harangue, Æschines first shows that the motion of Ktesiphon
was illegal, in consequence of the public official appointments
held by Demosthenes at the moment when it was proposed—next he
enters at large into the whole life and character of Demosthenes,
to prove him unworthy of such an honor, even if there had been no
formal grounds of objection. He distributes the entire life of
Demosthenes into four periods, the first ending at the peace of 346
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, between Philip and the Athenians—the
second, ending with the breaking out of the next ensuing war in
341-340 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—the third, ending with the disaster
at Chæroneia—the fourth, comprising all the time following.<a
id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>
Throughout all the four periods, he denounces the conduct of
Demosthenes as having been corrupt, treacherous, cowardly, and
ruinous to the city. What is more surprising still—he expressly
charges him with gross subservience both to Philip and to Alexander,
at the very time when he was taking credit for a patriotic and
intrepid opposition to them.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686"
class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>That Athens had undergone sad defeat and humiliation, having
been driven from her independent and even presidential position
into the degraded character of a subject Macedonian city, since the
time when Demosthenes first began political life—was a fact but too
indisputable. Æschines even makes this a part of his case; arraigning
the traitorous mismanagement of Demosthenes as the cause of so
melancholy a revolution, and denouncing him as candidate for public
compliment or no better plea than a series of public calamities.<a
id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>
Having thus animadverted on the conduct of Demosthenes prior to
the battle of Chæroneia, Æschines proceeds to the more recent
past, and contends that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p.
290]</span> Demosthenes cannot be sincere in his pretended enmity
to Alexander, because he has let slip three successive occasions,
all highly favorable, for instigating Athens to hostility against
the Macedonians. Of these three occasions, the first was, when
Alexander first crossed into Asia; the second, immediately before
the battle of Issus; the third, during the flush of success obtained
by Agis in Peloponnesus.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688"
class="fnanchor">[688]</a> On neither of these occasions did
Demosthenes call for any public action against Macedonia; a proof
(according to Æschines) that his anti-Macedonian professions were
insincere.</p>

<p>I have more than once remarked, that considering the bitter
enmity between the two orators, it is rarely safe to trust the
unsupported allegation of either against the other. But in regard
to the last-mentioned charges advanced by Æschines, there is enough
of known fact, and we have independent evidence, such as is not
often before us, to appreciate him as an accuser of Demosthenes.
The victorious career of Alexander, set forth in the preceding
chapters, proves amply that not one of the three periods, here
indicated by Æschines, presented even decent encouragement for a
reasonable Athenian patriot, to involve his country in warfare
against so formidable an enemy. Nothing can be more frivolous than
these charges against Demosthenes, of having omitted promising
seasons for anti-Macedonian operations. Partly for this reason,
probably, Demosthenes does not notice them in his reply; still more,
perhaps, on another ground, that it was not safe to speak out what
he thought and felt about Alexander. His reply dwells altogether
upon the period before the death of Philip. Of the boundless empire
subsequently acquired, by the son of Philip, he speaks only to mourn
it as a wretched visitation of fortune, which has desolated alike the
Hellenic and the barbaric world—in which Athens has been engulfed
along with others—and from which even those faithless and trimming
Greeks, who helped to aggrandize Philip, have not escaped better than
Athens, nor indeed so well.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689"
class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>I shall not here touch upon the Demosthenic speech De Coronâ
in a rhetorical point of view, nor add anything to those en<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span>comiums which have been
pronounced upon it with one voice, both in ancient and in modern
times, as the unapproachable masterpiece of Grecian oratory. To
this work it belongs as a portion of Grecian history; a retrospect
of the efforts made by a patriot and a statesman to uphold the
dignity of Athens and the autonomy of the Grecian world, against a
dangerous aggressor from without. How these efforts were directed,
and how they lamentably failed, has been recounted in my last
preceding volume. Demosthenes here passes them in review, replying
to the criminations against his public conduct during the interval
of ten years, between the peace of 346 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
(or the period immediately preceding it) and the death of Philip.
It is remarkable, that though professing to enter upon a defence
of his whole public life,<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690"
class="fnanchor">[690]</a> he nevertheless can afford to leave
unnoticed that portion of it which is perhaps the most honorable to
him—the early period of his first Philippics and Olynthiacs—when,
though a politician as yet immature and of no established footing,
he was the first to descry in the distance the perils threatened by
Philip’s aggrandizement, and the loudest in calling for timely and
energetic precautions against it; in spite of apathy and murmurs from
older politicians as well as from the general public. Beginning with
the peace of 346 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Demosthenes vindicates
his own share in the antecedents of that event against the charges
of Æschines, whom he denounces as the cause of all the mischief;
a controversy which I have already tried to elucidate, in my last
volume. Passing next to the period after that peace—to the four
years first of hostile diplomacy, then of hostile action, against
Philip, which ended with the disaster of Chæroneia—Demosthenes is
not satisfied with simple vindication. He re-asserts this policy as
matter of pride and honor, in spite of its results. He congratulates
his countrymen on having manifested a Pan-hellenic patriotism worthy
of their forefathers, and takes to himself only the credit of having
been forward to proclaim and carry out this glorious sentiment common
to all. Fortune has been adverse; yet the vigorous anti-Macedonian
policy was no mistake; Demosthenes swears it by the combatants
of Marathon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span>
Platæa and Salamis.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691"
class="fnanchor">[691]</a> To have had a foreign dominion obtruded
upon Greece, is an overwhelming calamity; but to have had this
accomplished without strenuous resistance on the part of Athens,
would have been calamity aggravated by dishonor.</p>

<p>Conceived in this sublime strain, the reply of Demosthenes to
his rival has an historical value, as a funeral oration of extinct
Athenian and Grecian freedom. Six years before, the orator had been
appointed by his countrymen to deliver the usual public oration over
the warriors slain at Chæroneia. That speech is now lost, but it
probably touched upon the same topics. Though the sphere of action,
of every Greek city as well as of every Greek citizen, was now
cramped and confined by irresistible Macedonian force; there still
remained the sentiment of full political freedom and dignity enjoyed
during the past—the admiration of ancestors who had once defended it
successfully—and the sympathy with leaders who had recently stood
forward to uphold it, however unsuccessfully. It is among the most
memorable facts in Grecian history, that in spite of the victory of
Philip at Chæroneia—in spite of the subsequent conquest of Thebes by
Alexander, and the danger of Athens after it—in spite of the Asiatic
conquests which had since thrown all Persian force into the hands
of the Macedonian king—the Athenian people could never be persuaded
either to repudiate Demosthenes, or to disclaim sympathy with his
political policy. How much art and ability was employed, to induce
them to do so, by his numerous enemies, the speech of Æschines is
enough to teach us. And when we consider how easily the public sicken
of schemes which end in misfortune—how great a mental relief is
usually obtained by throwing blame on unsuccessful leaders—it would
have been no matter of surprise, if, in one of the many prosecutions
wherein the fame of Demosthenes was involved, the Dikasts had
given a verdict unfavorable to him. That he always came off
acquitted, and even honorably acquitted, is a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span> proof of rare fidelity and steadiness
of mind in the Athenians. It is a proof that those noble, patriotic,
and Pan-hellenic sentiments, which we constantly find inculcated in
his orations, throughout a period of twenty years, had sunk into the
minds of his hearers; and that amidst the many general allegations of
corruption against him, loudly proclaimed by his enemies, there was
no one well-ascertained fact which they could substantiate before the
Dikastery.</p>

<p>The indictment now preferred by Æschines against Ktesiphon only
procured for Demosthenes a new triumph. When the suffrages of the
Dikasts were counted, Æschines did not obtain so much as one fifth.
He became therefore liable to the customary fine of 1000 drachmæ.
It appears that he quitted Athens immediately, without paying the
fine, and retired into Asia, from whence he never returned. He is
said to have opened a rhetorical school at Rhodes, and to have gone
into the interior of Asia during the last year of Alexander’s life
(at the time when that monarch was ordaining on the Grecian cities
compulsory restoration of all their exiles), in order to procure
assistance for returning to Athens. This project was disappointed
by Alexander’s death.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692"
class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>We cannot suppose that Æschines was unable to pay the fine of
1000 drachmæ, or to find friends who would pay it for him. It was
not therefore legal compulsion, but the extreme disappointment and
humiliation of so signal a defeat, which made him leave Athens.
We must remember that this was a gratuitous challenge sent by
himself; that the celebrity of the two rivals had brought together
auditors, not merely from Athens, but from various other Grecian
cities; and that the effect of the speech of Demosthenes in his
own defence,—delivered with all his perfection of voice and
action, and not only electrifying hearers by the sublimity of its
public sentiment, but also full of admirably managed self-praise,
and contemptuous bitterness towards his rival—must have been
inexpressibly powerful and commanding. Probably the friends of
Æschines became themselves angry with him for having brought
the indictment forward. For the effect<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> of his defeat must have been that the
vote of the Senate which he indicted, was brought forward and passed
in the public assembly; and that Demosthenes must have received
a public coronation.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693"
class="fnanchor">[693]</a> In no other way, under the existing
circumstances of Athens, could Demosthenes have obtained so emphatic
a compliment. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that such a
mortification was insupportable to Æschines. He became disgusted with
his native city. We read that afterwards, in his rhetorical school
at Rhodes, he one day declaimed, as a lesson to his pupils, the
successful oration of his rival, De Coronâ. Of course it excited a
burst of admiration. “What, if you had heard the beast himself speak
it!”—exclaimed Æschines.</p>

<p>From this memorable triumph of the illustrious orator and
defendant, we have to pass to another trial—a direct accusation
brought against him, from which he did not escape so successfully.
We are compelled here to jump over five years and a half (August 330
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, to January 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
during which we have no information about Grecian history; the
interval between Alexander’s march into Baktria and his return to
Persis and Susiana. Displeased with the conduct of the satraps during
his absence, Alexander put to death or punished several, and directed
the rest to disband without delay the mercenary soldiers whom they
had taken into pay. This peremptory order filled both Asia and Europe
with roving detachments of unprovided soldiers, some of whom sought
subsistence in the Grecian islands and on the Lacedæmonian southern
coast, at Cape Tænarus in Laconia.</p>

<p>It was about this period (the beginning of 324
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), that Harpalus the satrap of Babylonia
and Syria, becoming alarmed at the prospect of being punished by
Alexander for his ostentatious prodigalities, fled from Asia into
Greece, with a considera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p.
295]</span>ble treasure and a body of 5000 soldiers.<a
id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
While satrap, he had invited into Asia, in succession, two Athenian
women as mistresses, Pythionikê and Glykera, to each of whom he
was much attached, and whom he entertained with lavish expense
and pomp. On the death of the first, he testified his sorrow by
two costly funereal monuments to her memory; one at Babylon, the
other in Attica, between Athens and Eleusis. With Glykera he is
said to have resided at Tarsus in Kilikia,—to have ordered that
men should prostrate themselves before her, and address her as
queen—and to have erected her statue along with his own at Rhossus,
a seaport on the confines of Kilikia and Syria.<a id="FNanchor_695"
href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> To please these
mistresses, or perhaps to ensure a retreat for himself in case
of need, he had sent to Athens profuse gifts of wheat for
distribution among the people, for which he had received votes of
thanks with the grant of Athenian citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_696"
href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Moreover he
had consigned to Charikles, son-in-law of Phokion, the task of
erecting the monument in Attica to the honor of Pythionikê; with
a large remittance of money for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_697"
href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> The profit or
embezzlement arising out of this expenditure secured to him the good
will of Charikles—a man very different from his father-in-law, the
honest and austere Phokion. Other Athenians were probably conciliated
by various presents, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p.
296]</span> when Harpalus found it convenient to quit Asia, about
the beginning of 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, he had already
acquired some hold both on the public of Athens and on some of her
leading men. He sailed with his treasure and his armament straight
to Cape Sunium in Attica, from whence he sent to ask shelter and
protection in that city.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698"
class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>The first reports transmitted to Asia appear to have proclaimed
that the Athenians had welcomed Harpalus as a friend and ally, thrown
off the Macedonian yoke, and prepared for a war to re-establish
Hellenic freedom. Such is the color of the case, as presented
in the satiric drama called Agên, exhibited before Alexander
in the Dionysiac festival at Susa, in February or March 324
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Such news, connecting itself in Alexander’s
mind with the recent defeat of Zopyrion in Thrace and other disorders
of the disbanded mercenaries, incensed him so much, that he at
first ordered a fleet to be equipped, determining to cross over and
attack Athens in person.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699"
class="fnanchor">[699]</a> But he was presently<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span> calmed by more correct intelligence,
certifying that the Athenians had positively refused to espouse
the cause of Harpalus.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700"
class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p>The fact of such final rejection by the Athenians is quite
indisputable. But it seems, as far as we can make out from imperfect
evidence, that this step was not taken without debate, nor without
symptoms of a contrary disposition, sufficient to explain the
rumors first sent to Alexander. The first arrival of Harpalus
with his armament at Sunium, indeed, excited alarm, as if he were
coming to take possession of Peiræus; and the admiral Philokles
was instructed to adopt precautions for defence of the harbor.<a
id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
But Harpalus, sending away his armament to Krete or to Tænarus,
solicited and obtained permission to come to Athens, with a single
ship and his own personal attendants. What was of still greater
moment, he brought with him a large sum of money, amounting, we
are told to upwards of 700 talents, or more than £160,000. We must
recollect that he was already favorably known to the people by large
presents of corn, which had procured for him a vote of citizenship.
He now threw himself upon their gratitude as a suppliant seeking
protection against the wrath of Alexander; and while entreating
from the Athenians an interference so hazardous to themselves, he
did not omit to encourage them by exaggerating the means at his
own disposal. He expatiated on the universal hatred and discontent
felt against Alexander, and held out assurance of being joined
by powerful allies, foreign as well as Greek, if once a city
like Ath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span>ens
would raise the standard of liberation.<a id="FNanchor_702"
href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> To many Athenian
patriots, more ardent than long-sighted, such appeals inspired both
sympathy and confidence. Moreover Harpalus would of course purchase
every influential partisan who would accept a bribe; in addition
to men like Charikles, who were already in his interest. His cause
was espoused by Hyperides,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703"
class="fnanchor">[703]</a> an earnest anti-Macedonian citizen, and
an orator second only to Demosthenes. There seems good reason for
believing that at first, a strong feeling was excited in favor of
taking part with the exile; the people not being daunted even by the
idea of war with Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704"
class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<p>Phokion, whom Harpalus vainly endeavored to corrupt, resisted
of course the proposition of espousing his cause. And Demosthenes
also resisted it, not less decidedly, from the very out<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span>set.<a id="FNanchor_705"
href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> Notwithstanding
all his hatred of Macedonian supremacy, he could not be blind to
the insanity of declaring war against Alexander. Indeed those who
study his orations throughout, will find his counsels quite as much
distinguished for prudence as for vigorous patriotism. His prudence,
on this occasion, however, proved injurious to his political
position; for while it incensed Hyperides and the more sanguine
anti-Macedonians, it probably did not gain for himself anything
beyond a temporary truce from his old macedonizing opponents.</p>

<p id="Thimbron">The joint opposition of politicians so discordant
as Demosthenes and Phokion, prevailed over the impulse which the
partisans of Harpalus had created. No decree could be obtained in
his favor. Presently however the case was complicated by the coming
of envoys from Antipater and Olympias in Macedonia, requiring that
he should be surrendered.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706"
class="fnanchor">[706]</a> The like requisition was also addressed
by the Macedonian admiral Philoxenus, who arrived with a small
squadron from Asia. These demands were refused, at the instance of
Phokion no less than of Demosthenes. Nevertheless the prospects of
Macedonian vengeance were now brought in such fearful proximity
before the people, that all disposition to support Harpalus gave
way to the necessity of propitiating Alexander. A decree was passed
to arrest Harpalus, and to place all his money under sequestration
in the acropolis, until special directions could be received from
Alexander; to whom, apparently, envoys were sent, carrying with them
the slaves of Harpalus to be interrogated by him, and instructed
to solicit a lenient sentence at his hands.<a id="FNanchor_707"
href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Now it was
Demosthenes who moved these decrees for personal arrest and for
sequestration of the money;<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708"
class="fnanchor">[708]</a> whereby he incurred still warmer
resent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span>ment from
Hyperides and the other Harpalian partisans, who denounced him
as a subservient creature of the all-powerful monarch. Harpalus
was confined, but presently made his escape; probably much to the
satisfaction of Phokion, Demosthenes, and every one else; for even
those who were most anxious to get rid of him would recoil from the
odium and dishonor of surrendering him, even under constraint, to a
certain death. He fled to Krete, where he was soon after slain by
one of his own companions.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709"
class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>At the time when the decrees for arrest and sequestration were
passed, Demosthenes requested a citizen near him to ask Harpalus
publicly in the assembly, what was the amount of his money, which
the people had just resolved to impound.<a id="FNanchor_710"
href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Harpalus answered,
720 talents; and Demosthenes proclaimed this sum to the people,
on the authority of Harpalus, dwelling with some emphasis upon
its magnitude. But when the money came to be counted in the
acropolis, it was discovered that there was in reality no more
than 350 talents. Now it is said that Demosthenes did not at once
communicate to the people this prodigious deficiency in the real
sum as compared with the announcement of Harpalus, repeated in the
public assembly by himself. The impression prevailed, for how long
a time we do not know, that 720 Harpalian talents had actually been
lodged in the acropolis; and when the truth became at length known,
great surprise and out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p.
301]</span>cry were excited.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711"
class="fnanchor">[711]</a> It was assumed that the missing half
of the sum set forth must have been employed in corruption; and
suspicions prevailed against almost all the orators, Demosthenes and
Hyperides both included.</p>

<p>In this state of doubt, Demosthenes moved that the Senate of
Areopagus should investigate the matter and report who were the
presumed delinquents<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712"
class="fnanchor">[712]</a> fit to be indicted before the Dikastery;
he declared in the speech accompanying his motion that the real
delinquents, whoever they might be, deserved to be capitally
punished. The Areopagites delayed their report for six months,
though Demosthenes is said to have called for it with some
impatience. Search was made in the houses of the leading orators,
excepting only one who was recently married.<a id="FNanchor_713"
href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> At length the
report appeared, enumerating several names of citizens chargeable
with the appropriation of this money, and specifying how much had
been taken by each. Among these names were Demosthenes himself,
charged with 20 talents—Demades charged with 6000 golden staters—and
other citizens, with different sums attached to their names.<a
id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
Upon this report, ten<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715"
class="fnanchor">[715]</a> public accusers were appointed to
prosecute the indictment against the persons specified, before the
Dikastery. Among the accusers was Hyperides, whose name had not
been comprised in the Areo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p.
302]</span>pagitic report. Demosthenes was brought to trial,
first of all the persons accused, before a numerous Dikastery
of 1500 citizens,<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716"
class="fnanchor">[716]</a> who confirmed the report of the
Areopagites, found him guilty, and condemned him to pay fifty talents
to the state. Not being able to discharge this large fine, he was
put in prison; but after some days he found means to escape, and
fled to Trœzen in Peloponnesus, where he passed some months as a
dispirited and sorrowing exile, until the death of Alexander.<a
id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
What was done with the other citizens included in the Areopagitic
report, we do not know. It appears that Demades<a id="FNanchor_718"
href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>—who was among those
comprised, and who is especially attacked, along with Demosthenes,
by both Hyperides and Deinarchus—did not appear to take his trial,
and therefore must have been driven into exile; yet if so, he must
have speedily returned, since he seems to have been at Athens when
Alexander died. Philokles and Aristogeiton were also brought to
trial as being included by the Areopagus in the list of delinquents;
but how their trial ended, does not appear.<a id="FNanchor_719"
href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>This condemnation and banishment of Demosthenes—unquestionably
the greatest orator, and one of the greatest citizens, in Athenian
antiquity,—is the most painful result of the debates respecting
the exile Harpalus. Demosthenes himself denied the charge; but
unfortunately we possess neither his defence, nor the facts alleged
in evidence against him; so that our means of forming a positive
conclusion are imperfect. At the same time, judging from the
circumstances as far as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p.
303]</span> know them—there are several which go to show his
innocence, and none which tend to prove him guilty. If we are called
upon to believe that he received money from Harpalus, we must know
for what service the payment was made. Did Demosthenes take part
with Harpalus, and advise the Athenians to espouse his cause? Did
he even keep silence, and abstain from advising them to reject the
propositions? Quite the reverse. Demosthenes was from the beginning
a declared opponent of Harpalus, and of all measures for supporting
his cause. Plutarch indeed tells an anecdote—that Demosthenes began
by opposing Harpalus, but that presently he was fascinated by the
beauty of a golden cup among the Harpalian treasures. Harpalus,
perceiving his admiration, sent to him on the ensuing night the
golden cup, together with twenty talents, which Demosthenes accepted.
A few days afterwards, when the cause of Harpalus was again debated
in the public assembly, the orator appeared with his throat enveloped
in woollen wrappers, and affected to have lost his voice; upon
which the people, detecting this simulated inability as dictated
by the bribe which had been given, expressed their displeasure
partly by sarcastic taunts, partly by indignant murmuring.<a
id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
So stands the anecdote in Plutarch. But we have proof that it is
untrue. Demosthenes may indeed have been disabled by sore throat
from speaking at some particular assembly; so far the story may be
accurate; but that he desisted from opposing Harpalus (the real
point of the allegation against him) is certainly not true; for we
know from his accusers Deinarchus and Hyperides, that it was he who
made the final motion for imprisoning Harpalus and sequestrating
the Harpalian treasure in trust for Alexander. In fact, Hyperides
himself denounces Demosthenes, as having from subservience to
Alexander, closed the door against Harpalus and his prospects.<a
id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>
Such direct and continued opposition is a conclusive proof that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span> Demosthenes was neither
paid nor bought by Harpalus. The only service which he rendered to
the exile was, by refusing to deliver him to Antipater, and by not
preventing his escape from imprisonment. Now in this refusal even
Phokion concurred; and probably the best Athenians, of all parties,
were desirous of favoring the escape of an exile whom it would
have been odious to hand over to a Macedonian executioner. Insofar
as it was a crime not to have prevented the escape of Harpalus,
the crime was committed as much by Phokion as by Demosthenes; and
indeed more, seeing that Phokion was one of the generals, exercising
the most important administrative duties—while Demosthenes was
only an orator and mover in the assembly. Moreover, Harpalus had
no means of requiting the persons, whoever they were, to whom he
owed his escape; for the same motion which decreed his arrest,
decreed also the sequestration of his money, and thus removed it
from his own control.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722"
class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>The charge therefore made against Demosthenes by his two
accusers,—that he received money <i>from</i> Harpalus,—is one which all
the facts known to us tend to refute. But this is not quite the whole
case. Had Demosthenes the means of embezzling the money, after it
had passed out of the control of Harpalus? To this question also
we may reply in the negative, so far as Athenian practice enables
us to judge. Demosthenes had moved, and the people had voted, that
these treasures should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p.
305]</span> lodged in trust for Alexander, in the acropolis; a
place where all the Athenian public money was habitually kept—in
the back chamber of the Parthenon. When placed in that chamber,
these new treasures would come under the custody of the officers
of the Athenian exchequer; and would be just as much out of the
reach of Demosthenes as the rest of the public money. What more
could Phokion himself have done to preserve the Harpalian fund
intact, than to put it in the recognized place of surety? Then,
as to the intermediate process, of taking the money from Harpalus
up to the acropolis, there is no proof,—and in my judgment no
probability,—that Demosthenes was at all concerned in it. Even to
count, verify, and weigh, a sum of above £80,000—not in bank notes
or bills of exchange, but subdivided in numerous and heavy coins
(staters, darics, tetradrachms), likely to be not even Attic, but
Asiatic—must have been a tedious duty requiring to be performed
by competent reckoners, and foreign to the habits of Demosthenes.
The officers of the Athenian treasury must have gone through this
labor, providing the slaves or mules requisite for carrying so heavy
a burthen up to the acropolis. Now we have ample evidence from
the remaining Inscriptions, that the details of transfering and
verifying the public property, at Athens, were performed habitually
with laborious accuracy. Least of all would such accuracy be found
wanting in the case of the large Harpalian treasure, where the
very passing of the decree implied great fear of Alexander. If
Harpalus, on being publicly questioned in the assembly—What was the
sum to be carried up into the acropolis,—answered by stating the
amount which he had originally brought and not that which he had
remaining—Demosthenes might surely repeat that statement immediately
after him, without being understood thereby to bind himself down
as guarantee for its accuracy. An adverse pleader, like Hyperides,
might indeed turn a point in his speech<a id="FNanchor_723"
href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>—“<i>You</i> told the
assem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span>bly that
there were 700 talents, and now <i>you</i> produce no more than half”—but
the imputation wrapped up in these words against the probity of
Demosthenes, is utterly groundless. Lastly, when the true amount was
ascertained, to make report thereof was the duty of the officers of
the treasury. Demosthenes could only learn it from them; and it might
certainly be proper in him, though in no sense an imperative duty,
to inform himself on the point, seeing that he had unconsciously
helped to give publicity to a false statement. The true statement was
given; but we neither know by whom, nor how soon.<a id="FNanchor_724"
href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Reviewing the facts known to us, therefore, we find them all
tending to refute the charge against Demosthenes. This conclusion
will certainly be strengthened by reading the accusatory speech
composed by Deinarchus; which is mere virulent invective, barren
of facts and evidentiary matter, and running over all the life of
Demosthenes for the preceding twenty years. That the speech of
Hyperides also was of the like desultory character, the remaining
fragments indicate. Even the report made by the Areopagus contained
no recital of facts—no justificatory matter—nothing except a
specification of names with the sums for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_307">[p. 307]</span> which each of them is chargeable.<a
id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> It
appears to have been made <i>ex-parte</i>, as far as we can judge—that
is, made without hearing these persons in their own defence, unless
they happened to be themselves Areopagites. Yet this report is held
forth both by Hyperides and Deinarchus as being in itself conclusive
proof which the Dikasts could not reject. When Demosthenes demanded,
as every defendant naturally would, that the charge against him
should be proved by some positive evidence, Hyperides sets aside
the demand as nothing better than cavil and special pleading.<a
id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a></p>

<p>One farther consideration remains to be noticed. Only nine months
after the verdict of the Dikastery against Demosthenes, Alexander
died. Presently the Athenians and other Greeks rose against Antipater
in the struggle called the Lamian war. Demosthenes was then recalled;
received from his countrymen an enthusiastic welcome, such as
had never been accorded to any returning exile since the days of
Alkibiades; took a leading part in the management of the war; and
perished, on its disastrous termination, along with his accuser
Hyperides.</p>

<p>Such speedy revolution of opinion about Demosthenes, countenances
the conclusion which seems to me suggested by the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span> other circumstances
of the case—that the verdict against him was not judicial, but
political; growing out of the embarrassing necessities of the
time.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Harpalus, to whom a declaration of
active support from the Athenians was matter of life and death,
distributed various bribes to all consenting recipients, who
could promote his views,—and probably even to some who simply
refrained from opposing them; to all, in short, except pronounced
opponents. If we were to judge from probabilities alone, we should
say that Hyperides himself, as one of the chief supporters,
would also be among the largest recipients.<a id="FNanchor_727"
href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Here was abundant
bribery—notorious in the mass, though perhaps untraceable in the
detail—all consummated during the flush of promise which marked the
early discussions of the Harpalian case. When the tide of sentiment
turned—when fear of Macedonian force became the overwhelming
sentiment—when Harpalus and his treasures were impounded in
trust for Alexander—all these numerous receivers of bribes were
already compromised and alarmed. They themselves probably, in
order to divert suspicion, were among the loudest in demanding
investigation and punishment against delinquents. Moreover, the
city was responsible for 700 talents to Alexander, while no more
than 350 were forthcoming.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728"
class="fnanchor">[728]</a> It was indispensable that some definite
individuals should be pronounced guilty and punished, partly in order
to put down the reciprocal criminations circulating through the city,
partly in order to appease the displeasure of Alexander about the
pecuniary deficiency. But how to find out who were the guilty? There
was no official Prosecutor-general; the number of persons suspected
would place the matter beyond the reach of private accusations;
perhaps the course recommended by Demosthenes himself was the best,
to consign this preliminary investigation to the Areopagites.</p>

<p>Six months elapsed before these Areopagites made their
report.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span> Now it is
impossible to suppose that all this time could have been spent in the
investigation of facts—and if it had been, the report when published
would have contained some trace of these facts, instead of embodying
a mere list of names and sums. The probability is, that their time
was passed quite as much in party-discussions as in investigating
facts; that dissentient parties were long in coming to an agreement
whom they should sacrifice; and that when they did agree, it was a
political rather than a judicial sentence, singling out Demosthenes
as a victim highly acceptable to Alexander, and embodying Demades
also, by way of compromise, in the same list of delinquents—two
opposite politicians, both at the moment obnoxious. I have already
observed that Demosthenes was at that time unpopular with both the
reigning parties: with the philo-Macedonians, from long date, and
not without sufficient reason; with the anti-Macedonians, because he
had stood prominent in opposing Harpalus. His accusers count upon
the hatred of the former against him, as a matter of course; they
recommend him to the hatred of the latter, as a base creature of
Alexander. The Dikasts doubtless included men of both parties; and
as a collective body, they might probably feel, that to ratify the
list presented by the Areopagus was the only way of finally closing a
subject replete with danger and discord.</p>

<p>Such seems the probable history of the Harpalian transactions. It
leaves Demosthenes innocent of corrupt profit, not less than Phokion;
but to the Athenian politicians generally, it is noway creditable;
while it exhibits the judicial conscience of Athens as under pressure
of dangers from without, worked upon by party-intrigues within.<a
id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>During the half-year and more which elapsed between the arrival of
Harpalus at Athens, and the trial of Demosthenes, one event at least
of considerable moment occurred in Greece. Alex<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span>ander sent Nicanor to the great Olympic
festival held in this year, with a formal letter or rescript,
directing every Grecian city to recall all its citizens that were in
exile, except such as were under the taint of impiety. The rescript,
which was publicly read at the festival by the herald who had gained
the prize for loudness of voice, was heard with the utmost enthusiasm
by 20,000 exiles, who had mustered there from intimations that such
a step was intended. It ran thus: “King Alexander to the exiles out
of the Grecian cities—We have not been authors of your banishment,
but we will be authors of your restoration to your native cities. We
have written to Antipater about this matter, directing him to apply
force to such cities as will not recall you of their own accord.”<a
id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>It is plain that many exiles had been pouring out their
complaints and accusations before Alexander, and had found him a
willing auditor. But we do not know by what representations this
rescript had been procured. It would seem that Antipater had orders
farther, to restrain or modify the confederacies of the Achæan
and Arcadian cities;<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731"
class="fnanchor">[731]</a> and to enforce not merely recall of the
exiles, but restitution of their properties.<a id="FNanchor_732"
href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>That the imperial rescript was dictated by mistrust of the tone of
sentiment in the Grecian cities generally, and intended to fill each
city with devoted partisans of Alexander—we cannot doubt. It was on
his part a high-handed and sweeping exercise of sovereignty—setting
aside the conditions under which he had been named leader of
Greece—disdaining even to inquire into particular cases, and to
attempt a distinction between just and unjust sentences—overruling
in the mass the political and judicial authorities in every city. It
proclaimed with bitter emphasis the servitude of the hellenic world.
Exiles restored under the coercive order of Alexander, were sure to
look to Macedonia for support, to despise their own home authorities,
and to fill their respective cities with enfeebling discord. Most
of the cities, not daring to resist, appear to have yielded a
reluctant obedience; but both the Athenians and Ætolians are said to
have refused to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span>
execute the order.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733"
class="fnanchor">[733]</a> It is one evidence of the disgust raised
by the rescript at Athens, that Demosthenes is severely reproached
by Deinarchus, because, as chief of the Athenian Theôry or sacred
legation to the Olympic festival, he was seen there publicly
consorting and in familiar converse with Nikanor.<a id="FNanchor_734"
href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>In the winter or early spring of 323 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
several Grecian cities sent envoys into Asia to remonstrate with
Alexander against the measure; we may presume that the Athenians
were among them; but we do not know whether the remonstrance
produced any effect.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735"
class="fnanchor">[735]</a> There appears to have been considerable
discontent in Greece during this winter and spring (323
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). The disbanded soldiers out of Asia
still maintained a camp at Tænarus; where Leosthenes, an energetic
Athenian of anti-Macedonian sentiments, accepted the command of
them, and even attracted fresh mercenary soldiers from Asia, under
concert with various confederates at Athens, and with the Ætolians.<a
id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>
Of the money, said to be 5000 talents, brought by Harpalus out of
Asia, the greater part had not been taken by Harpalus to Athens, but
apparently left with his officers for the maintenance of the troops
who had accompanied him over.</p>

<p>Such was the general position of affairs, when Alexander died
at Babylon in June 323 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> This astounding
news, for which no one could have been prepared, must have
become diffused throughout Greece during the month of July. It
opened the most favorable prospects to all lovers of freedom and
sufferers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span> by
Macedonian dominion. The imperial military force resembled the
gigantic Polyphemus after his eye had been blinded by Odysseus:<a
id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
Alexander had left no competent heir, nor did any one imagine that
his vast empire could be kept together in effective unity by other
hands. Antipater in Macedonia was threatened with the defection of
various subject neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738"
class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>No sooner was the death of Alexander indisputably certified, than
the anti-Macedonian leaders in Athens vehemently instigated the
people to declare themselves first champions of Hellenic freedom,
and to organize a confederacy throughout Greece for that object.
Demosthenes was then in exile; but Leosthenes, Hyperides and other
orators of the same party, found themselves able to kindle in
their countrymen a strenuous feeling and determination, in spite
of decided opposition on the part of Phokion and his partisans.<a
id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
The rich men for the most part took the side of Phokion, but the
mass of the citizens were fired by the animating recollection of
their ancestors and by the hopes of reconquering Grecian freedom.
A vote was passed, publicly proclaiming their resolution to that
effect. It was decreed that 200 quadriremes, and 40 triremes should
be equipped; that all Athenians under 40 years of age should be in
military requisition; and that envoys should be sent round to the
various Grecian cities, earnestly invoking their alliance in the
work of self-emancipation.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740"
class="fnanchor">[740]</a> Phokion, though a pronounced opponent of
such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span> warlike
projects, still remained at Athens, and still, apparently, continued
in his functions as one of the generals.<a id="FNanchor_741"
href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> But Pytheas,
Kallimedon, and others of his friends, fled to Antipater, whom
they strenuously assisted in trying to check the intended movement
throughout Greece.</p>

<p>Leosthenes, aided by some money and arms from Athens, put himself
at the head of the mercenaries assembled at Tænarus, and passed
across the Gulf into Ætolia. Here he was joined by the Ætolians and
Akarnanians, who eagerly entered into the league with Athens for
expelling the Macedonians from Greece. Proceeding onward towards
Thermopylæ and Thessaly, he met with favor and encouragement almost
everywhere. The cause of Grecian freedom was espoused by the
Phokians, Lokrians, Dorians, Ænianes, Athamantes, and Dolopes; by
most of the Malians, Œtæans, Thessalians, and Achæans of Phthiôtis;
by the inhabitants of Leukas, and by some of the Molossians. Promises
were also held out of co-operation from various Illyrian and Thracian
tribes. In Peloponnesus, the Argeians, Sikyonians, Epidaurians,
Trœzenians, Eleians, and Messenians, enrolled themselves in the
league, as well as the Karystians in Eubœa.<a id="FNanchor_742"
href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> These adhesions were
partly procured by Hyperides and other Athenian envoys, who visited
the several cities; while Pytheas and other envoys were going round
in like matter to advocate the cause of Antipater. The two sides
were thus publicly argued by able pleaders before different public
assemblies. In these debates, the advantage was generally on the
side of the Athenian orators, whose efforts moreover were powerfully
seconded by the voluntary aid of Demosthenes, then living as an exile
in Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>To Demosthenes the death of Alexander, and the new prospect
of organizing an anti-Macedonian confederacy with some tolerable
chance of success, came more welcome than to any one else. He gladly
embraced the opportunity of joining and assist<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span>ing the Athenian envoys, who felt the
full value of his energetic eloquence, in the various Peloponnesian
towns. So effective was the service which he thus rendered to his
country, that the Athenians not only passed a vote to enable him to
return, but sent a trireme to fetch him to Peiræus. Great was the
joy and enthusiasm on his arrival. The archons, the priests, and
the entire body of citizens, came down to the harbor to welcome his
landing, and escorted him to the city. Full of impassioned emotion,
Demosthenes poured forth his gratitude for having been allowed to see
such a day, and to enjoy a triumph greater even than that which had
been conferred on Alkibiades on returning from exile; since it had
been granted spontaneously, and not extorted by force. His fine could
not be remitted, consistently with Athenian custom; but the people
passed a vote granting to him fifty talents as superintendent of the
periodical sacrifice to Zeus Soter; and his execution of this duty
was held equivalent to a liquidation of the fine.<a id="FNanchor_743"
href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>What part Demosthenes took in the plans or details of the war, we
are not permitted to know. Vigorous operations were now carried on,
under the military command of Leosthenes. The confederacy against
Antipater included a larger assemblage of Hellenic states than
that which had resisted Xerxes in 480 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
Nevertheless, the name of Sparta does not appear in the list. It
was a melancholy drawback to the chances of Greece, in this her
last struggle for emancipation, that the force of Sparta had been
altogether crushed in the gallant but ill-concerted effort of Agis
against Antipater seven years before, and had not since recovered.
The great stronghold of Macedonian interest, in the interior of
Greece, was Bœotia. Platæa, Orchomenus, and the other ancient enemies
of Thebes, having received from Alexander the domain once belonging
to Thebes herself, were well aware that this arrangement could only
be upheld by the continued pressure of Macedonian supremacy in
Greece. It seems probable also that there were Macedonian garrisons
in the Kadmeia—in Corinth—and in Megalopolis; moreover, that the
Arcadian and Achæan cities had been macedonized by the measures
taken against them under Alexander’s orders in the pre<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span>ceding summer;<a
id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
for we find no mention made of these cities in the coming contest.
The Athenians equipped a considerable land-force to join Leosthenes
at Thermopylæ; a citizen force of 5000 infantry and 500 cavalry,
with 2000 mercenaries besides. But the resolute opposition of the
Bœotian cities hindered them from advancing beyond Mount Kithæron,
until Leosthenes himself, marching from Thermopylæ to join them
with a part of his army, attacked the Bœotian troops, gained a
complete victory, and opened the passage. He now proceeded with
the full Hellenic muster, including Ætolians and Athenians, into
Thessaly to meet Antipater, who was advancing from Macedonia into
Greece at the head of the force immediately at his disposal—13,000
infantry, and 600 cavalry—and with a fleet of 110 ships of war
co-operating on the coast.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745"
class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>Antipater was probably not prepared for this rapid and imposing
assemblage of the combined Greeks at Thermopylæ, nor for the
energetic movements of Leosthenes. Still less was he prepared for
the defection of the Thessalian cavalry, who, having always formed
an important element in the Macedonian army, now lent their strength
to the Greeks. He despatched urgent messages to the Macedonian
commanders in Asia—Kraterus, Leonnatus, Philotas, etc., soliciting
reinforcements; but in the mean time, though inferior in numbers,
he thought it expedient to accept the challenge of Leosthenes. In
the battle which ensued, however, he was completely defeated, and
even cut off from the possibility of retreating into Macedonia;
so that no resource was left to him except the fortified town of
Lamia (near to the river Spercheius, beyond the southern border of
Thessaly), where he calculated on holding out until relief came
from Asia. Leosthenes immediately commenced the siege of Lamia,
and pressed it with the utmost energy, making several attempts to
storm the town; but its fortifications were strong, with a garrison
ample and efficient—so that he was repulsed with consider<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span>able loss. Unfortunately
he possessed no battering train nor engineers, such as had formed
so powerful an element in the military successes of Philip and
Alexander. He therefore found himself compelled to turn the siege
into a blockade, and to adopt systematic measures for intercepting
the supply of provisions. In this he had every chance of succeeding,
and of capturing the person of Antipater. Hellenic prospects looked
bright and encouraging; nothing was heard in Athens and the other
cities except congratulations and thanksgivings.<a id="FNanchor_746"
href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Phokion, on
hearing the confident language of those around him remarked—“The
stadium (or short course) has been done brilliantly, but I fear
we shall not have strength to hold out for the long course.”<a
id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
At this critical moment, Leosthenes, in inspecting the blockading
trenches, was wounded on the head by a large stone, projected from
one of the catapults on the city-walls, and expired in two days.<a
id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
A funeral oration in his honor, as well as in that of the other
combatants against Antipater, was pronounced at Athens by
Hyperides, on whom the people devolved that duty in preference to
Demosthenes.</p>

<p>The death of this eminent general, in the full tide of success,
was a hard blow struck by fortune at the cause of Grecian
freedom. For the last generation, Athens had produced several
excellent orators, and one who combined splendid oratory with
wise and patriotic counsels. But during all that time, none of
her citizens, before Leosthenes had displayed military genius and
ardor along with Panhellenic purposes. His death appears to have
saved Antipater from defeat and captivity. The difficulty was very
great, of keeping together a miscellaneous army of Greeks, who
after the battle, easily persuaded themselves that the war was
finished, and desired to go home—perhaps under promise of returning.
Even during the lifetime of Leosthenes, the Ætolians, the most
powerful contingent of the army, had obtained leave to go home,
from some domestic urgency, real or pretended.<a id="FNanchor_749"
href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> When he was slain,
there was no second in command; nor, even if there had been, could
the personal influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p.
317]</span> of one officer be transferred to another. Reference
was made to Athens, where, after some debate, Antiphilus was
chosen commander, after the proposition to name Phokion had been
made and rejected.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750"
class="fnanchor">[750]</a> But during this interval there was no
authority to direct military operations, or even to keep the army
together; so that the precious moments for rendering the blockade
really stringent, were lost, and Antipater was enabled to maintain
himself until the arrival of Leonnatus from Asia to his aid. How
dangerous the position of Antipater was, we may judge from the
fact, that he solicited peace, but was required by the besiegers to
surrender at discretion<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751"
class="fnanchor">[751]</a>—with which condition he refused to
comply.</p>

<p>Antiphilus appears to have been a brave and competent officer.
But before he could reduce Lamia, Leonnatus with a Macedonian army
had crossed the Hellespont from Asia, and arrived at the frontiers
of Thessaly. So many of the Grecian contingents had left the camp,
that Antiphilus was not strong enough at once to continue the
blockade and to combat the relieving army. Accordingly, he raised
the blockade, and moved off by rapid marches to attack Leonnatus
apart from Antipater. He accomplished this operation with vigor
and success. Through the superior efficiency of the Thessalian
cavalry under Menon, he gained an important advantage in a cavalry
battle over Leonnatus, who was himself slain;<a id="FNanchor_752"
href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and the Macedonian
phalanx having its flanks and rear thus exposed, retired from the
plain to more difficult ground, leaving the Greeks masters of the
field with the dead bodies. On the very next day, Antipater came up
with the troops from Lamia, and took command of the defeated army.
He did not however think it expedient to renew the combat, but
withdrew his army from Thessaly into Macedonia, keeping in his march
the high ground, out of the reach of cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_753"
href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p>During the same time generally as these operations in Thessaly,
it appears that war was carried on actively by sea. We<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span> hear of a descent by
Mikion with a Macedonian fleet at Rhamnus on the eastern coast of
Attica, repulsed by Phokion; also of a Macedonian fleet, of 240
sail, under Kleitus, engaging in two battles with the Athenian fleet
under Eetion, near the islands called Echinades, at the mouth of the
Achelous, on the western Ætolian coast. The Athenians were defeated
in both actions, and great efforts were made at Athens to build
new vessels for the purpose of filling up the losses sustained.<a
id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
Our information is not sufficient to reveal the purposes or details
of these proceedings. But it seems probable that the Macedonian
fleet were attacking Ætolia through Œniadæ, the citizens of which
town had recently been expelled by the Ætolians;<a id="FNanchor_755"
href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> and perhaps this may
have been the reason why the Ætolian contingent was withdrawn from
Thessaly.</p>

<p>In spite of such untoward events at sea, the cause of Panhellenic
liberty seemed on the whole prosperous. Though the capital
opportunity had been missed, of taking Antipater captive in Lamia,
still he had been expelled from Greece, and was unable, by means
of his own forces in Macedonia, to regain his footing. The Grecian
contingents had behaved with bravery and unanimity in prosecution
of the common purpose; and what had been already achieved was
quite sufficient to justify the rising, as a fair risk, promising
reasonable hopes of success. Nevertheless Greek citizens were not
like trained Macedonian soldiers. After a term of service not much
prolonged, they wanted to go back to their families and properties,
hardly less after a victory than after a defeat. Hence the army of
Antiphilus in Thessaly became much thinned,<a id="FNanchor_756"
href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> though still
remaining large enough to keep back the Macedonian forces of
Antipater, even augmented as they had been by Leonnatus—and to compel
him to await the still more powerful reinforcement destined to follow
under Kraterus.</p>

<p>In explaining the relations between these three Macedonian
commanders—Antipater, Leonnatus, and Kraterus—it is necessary to go
back to June 323 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the period of Alexander’s
death, and to review the condition into which his vast and mighty
empire had fallen. I shall do this briefly, and only so far as
it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span> bears on the
last struggles and final subjugation of the Grecian world.</p>

<p>On the unexpected death of Alexander, the camp at Babylon with
its large force became a scene of discord. He left no offspring,
except a child named Herakles, by his mistress Barsinê. Roxana, one
of his wives, was indeed pregnant; and amidst the uncertainties of
the moment, the first disposition of many was to await the birth
of her child. She herself, anxious to shut out rivalry, caused
Statira, the queen whom Alexander had last married to be entrapped
and assassinated along with her sister.<a id="FNanchor_757"
href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> There was, however,
at Babylon, a brother of Alexander, named Aridæus (son of Philip
by a Thessalian mistress), already of full age though feeble in
intelligence, towards whom a still larger party leaned. In Macedonia,
there were Olympias, Alexander’s mother—Kleopatra, his sister,
widow of the Epirotic Alexander—and Kynanê,<a id="FNanchor_758"
href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> another sister, widow
of Amyntas (cousin of Alexander the Great, and put to death by him);
all of them disposed to take advantage of their relationship to the
deceased conqueror, in the scramble now opened for power.</p>

<p>After a violent dispute between the cavalry and the infantry
at Babylon, Aridæus was proclaimed king under the name of Philip
Aridæus. Perdikkas was named as his guardian and chief minister;
among the other chief officers, the various satrapies and fractions
of the empire were distributed. Egypt and Libya were assigned to
Ptolemy; Syria to Laomedon; Kilikia to Philôtas; Pamphylia, Lykia,
and the greater Phrygia, to Antigonus; Karia, to Asander; Lydia, to
Menander; the Hellespontine Phrygia, to Leonnatus; Kappadokia and
Paphlagonia, to the Kardian Eumenes; Media, to Pithon. The eastern
satrapies were left in the hands of the actual holders.</p>

<p>In Europe, the distributors gave Thrace with the Chersonese to
Lysimachus; the countries west of Thrace, including (along with
Illyrians, Triballi, Agrianes, and Epirots) Macedonia and Greece,
to Antipater and Kraterus.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759"
class="fnanchor">[759]</a> We thus find the Grecian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> cities handed over
to new masters, as fragments of the vast intestate estate left by
Alexander. The empty form of convening and consulting a synod of
deputies at Corinth, was no longer thought necessary.</p>

<p>All the above-named officers were considered as local lieutenants,
administering portions of an empire one and indivisible, under
Aridæus. The principal officers who enjoyed central authority,
bearing on the entire empire, were, Perdikkas, chiliarch of the horse
(the post occupied by Hephæstion until his death), a sort of vizir,<a
id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
and Seleukus, commander of the Horse Guards. No one at this moment
talked of dividing the empire. But it soon appeared that Perdikkas,
profiting by the weakness of Aridæus, had determined to leave to
him nothing more than the imperial name, and to engross for himself
the real authority. Still, however, in his disputes with the other
chiefs, he represented the imperial family, and the integrity of the
empire, contending against severality and local independence. In this
task (besides his brother Alketas), his ablest and most effective
auxiliary was Eumenes of Kardia, secretary of Alexander for several
years until his death. It was one of the earliest proceedings of
Perdikkas to wrest Kappadokia from the local chief Ariarathes (who
had contrived to hold it all through the reign of Alexander), and
to transfer it to Eumenes, to whom it had been allotted in the
general scheme of division.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761"
class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>At the moment of Alexander’s death, Kraterus was in Kilikia,
at the head of an army of veteran Macedonian soldiers. He had
been directed to conduct them home into Macedonia, with orders to
remain there himself in place of Antipater, who was to come over to
Asia with fresh reinforcements. Kraterus had with him a paper of
written instructions from Alexander, embodying projects on the most
gigantic scale; for western conquest—transportation of inhabitants
by wholesale from Europe into Asia and Asia into Europe—erection
of magnificent religious edifices in various parts of Greece and
Macedonia, etc. This list was submitted by Perdikkas to the officers
and soldiers around him, who dismissed the projects as too vast
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span> any one but
Alexander to think of.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762"
class="fnanchor">[762]</a> Kraterus and Antipater had each a
concurrent claim to Greece and Macedonia, and the distributors of the
empire had allotted these countries to them jointly, not venturing
to exclude either. Amidst the conflicting pretensions of these great
Macedonian officers, Leonnatus also cherished hopes of the same
prize. He was satrap of the Asiatic territory bordering upon the
Hellespont, and had received propositions from Kleopatra at Pella,
inviting him to marry her and assume the government of Macedonia.
About the same time, urgent messages were also sent to him (through
Hekatæus despot of Kardia) from Antipater, immediately after the
defeat preceding the siege of Lamia, entreating his co-operation
against the Greeks. Leonnatus accordingly came, intending to assist
Antipater against the Greeks, but also to dispossess him of the
government of Macedonia and marry Kleopatra.<a id="FNanchor_763"
href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> This scheme remained
unexecuted, because (as has been already related) Leonnatus was slain
in his first encounter with the Greeks. To them, his death was a
grave misfortune; to Antipater, it was an advantage which more than
countervailed the defeat, since it relieved him from a dangerous
rival.</p>

<p>It was not till the ensuing summer that Kraterus found leisure
to conduct his army into Macedonia. By this junction, Antipater to
whom he ceded the command, found himself at the head of a powerful
army—40,000 heavy infantry, 5000 cavalry, and 3000 archers and
slingers. He again marched into Thessaly against the Greeks under
Antiphilus; and the two armies came in sight on the Thessalian
plains near Krannon. The Grecian army consisted of 25,000 infantry,
and 3500 cavalry—the latter, Thessalians under Menon, of admirable
efficiency. The soldiers in general were brave, but insubordinate;
while the contingents of many cities had gone home without returning,
in spite of urgent remonstrances from the commander. Hoping to be
rejoined by these absentees, Antiphilus and Menon tried at first to
defer fighting; but Antipater forced them to a battle. Though Menon
with his Thessalian cavalry defeated and dispersed the Macedonian
cavalry, the Grecian infantry were unable to resist the superior
number of Antipater’s infantry, and the heavy<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span> pressure of the phalanx. They were
beaten back and gave way, yet retiring in tolerable order, the
Macedonian phalanx being incompetent for pursuit, to some difficult
neighboring ground, where they were soon joined by their victorious
cavalry. The loss of the Greeks is said to have been 500 men; that
of the Macedonians, 120.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764"
class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>The defeat of Krannon (August 322 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>)
was no way decisive or ruinous, nor would it probably have crushed
the spirit of Leosthenes, had he been alive and in command. The
coming up of the absentee contingents might still have enabled
the Greeks to make head. But Antiphilus and Menon, after holding
counsel, declined to await and accelerate that junction. They thought
themselves under the necessity of sending to open negotiations for
peace with Antipater; who however returned for answer, that he would
not recognize or treat with any Grecian confederacy, and that he
would receive no propositions except from each city severally. Upon
this the Grecian commanders at once resolved to continue the war,
and to invoke reinforcements from their countrymen. But their own
manifestation of timidity had destroyed the chance that remained of
such reinforcements arriving. While Antipater commenced a vigorous
and successful course of action against the Thessalian cities
separately, the Greeks became more and more dispirited and alarmed.
City after city sent its envoys to entreat peace from Antipater,
who granted lenient terms to each, reserving only the Athenians and
Ætolians. In a few days, the combined Grecian army was dispersed;
Antiphilus with the Athenians returned into Attica; Antipater
followed them southward as far as Bœotia, taking up his quarters at
the Macedonian post on the Kadmeia, once the Hellenic Thebes—within
two days’ march of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765"
class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>Against the overwhelming force thus on the frontiers of Attica,
the Athenians had no means of defence. The principal anti-Macedonian
orators, especially Demosthenes and Hyperides, retired from the
city at once, seeking sanctuary in the temples of Kalauria and
Ægina. Phokion and Demades, as the envoys<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span> most acceptable to Antipater, were
sent to Kadmeia as bearers of the submission of the city, and
petitioners for lenient terms. Demades is said to have been at this
time disfranchised and disqualified from public speaking—having been
indicted and found guilty thrice (some say seven times) under the
Graphê Paranomon; but the Athenians passed a special vote of relief,
to enable him to resume his functions of citizen. Neither Phokion
nor Demades, however, could prevail upon Antipater to acquiesce
in anything short of the surrender of Athens at discretion; the
same terms as Leosthenes had required from Antipater himself at
Lamia. Kraterus was even bent upon marching forward into Attica,
to dictate terms under the walls of Athens; and it was not without
difficulty that Phokion obtained the abandonment of this intention;
after which he returned to Athens with the answer. The people had
no choice except to throw themselves on the mercy of Antipater;<a
id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> and
Phokion and Demades came back to Thebes to learn his determination.
This time they were accompanied by the philosopher Xenokrates—the
successor of Plato and Speusippus, as presiding teacher in the school
of the Academy. Though not a citizen of Athens, Xenokrates had long
resided there; and it was supposed that his dignified character and
intellectual eminence might be efficacious in mitigating the wrath
of the conqueror. Aristotle had quitted Athens for Chalkis before
this time; otherwise he, the personal friend of Antipater, would have
been probably selected for this painful mission. In point of fact,
Xenokrates did no good, being harshly received, and almost put to
silence by Antipater. One reason of this may be, that he had been to
a certain extent the rival of Aristotle; and it must be added to his
honor, that he maintained a higher and more independent tone than
either of the other envoys.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767"
class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span>According to
the terms dictated by Antipater, the Athenians were required to pay
a sum equal to the whole cost of the war; to surrender Demosthenes,
Hyperides, and seemingly at least two other anti-Macedonian orators;
to receive a Macedonian garrison in Munychia; to abandon their
democratical constitution and disfranchise all their poorer citizens.
Most of these poor men were to be transported from their homes, and
to receive new lands on a foreign shore. The Athenian colonists in
Samos were to be dipossessed and the island retransferred to the
Samian exiles and natives.</p>

<p>It is said that Phokion and Demades heard these terms
with satisfaction, as lenient and reasonable. Xenokrates
entered against them the strongest protest which the occasion
admitted, when he said<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768"
class="fnanchor">[768]</a>—“If Antipater looks upon us as slaves, the
terms are moderate; if as freemen, they are severe.” To Phokion’s
entreaty, that the introduction of the garrison might be dispensed
with, Antipater replied in the negative, intimating that the garrison
would be not less serviceable to Phokion himself than to the
Macedonians; while Kallimedon also, an Athenian exile there present,
repelled the proposition with scorn. Respecting the island of Samos,
Antipater was prevailed upon to allow a special reference to the
imperial authority.</p>

<p>If Phokion thought these terms lenient, we must imagine that
he expected a sentence of destruction against Athens, such as
Alexander had pronounced and executed against Thebes. Under no other
comparison can they appear lenient. Out of 21,000 qualified citizens
of Athens, all those who did not possess property to the amount of
2000 drachmæ were condemned to disfranchisement and deportation.
The number below this prescribed qualification, who came under the
penalty, was 12,000, or three-fifths of the whole. They were set
aside as turbulent, noisy democrats; the 9000 richest citizens, the
“party of order”, were left in exclusive possession, not only of the
citizenship, but of the city. The condemned 12,000 were deported out
of Attica, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span>
to Thrace, some to the Illyrian or Italian coast, some to Libya
or the Kyrenaic territory. Besides the multitude banished simply
on the score of comparative poverty, the marked anti-Macedonian
politicians were banished also, including Agnonides, the friend of
Demosthenes, and one of his earnest advocates when accused respecting
the Harpalian treasures.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769"
class="fnanchor">[769]</a> At the request of Phokion, Antipater
consented to render the deportation less sweeping than he had
originally intended, so far as to permit some exiles, Agnonides
among the rest, to remain within the limits of Peloponnesus.<a
id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
We shall see him presently contemplating a still more wholesale
deportation of the Ætolian people.</p>

<p>It is deeply to be lamented that this important revolution,
not only cutting down Athens to less than one-half of her citizen
population, but involving a deportation fraught with individual
hardship and suffering, is communicated to us only in two or
three sentences of Plutarch and Diodorus, without any details
from contemporary observers. It is called by Diodorus a return
to the Solonian constitution; but the comparison disgraces the
name of that admirable lawgiver, whose changes, taken as a whole,
were prodigiously liberal and enfranchising, compared with what
he found established. The deportation ordained by Antipater must
indeed have brought upon the poor citizens of Athens a state of
suffering in foreign lands analogous to that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span> which Solon describes as having
preceded his Seisachtheia, or measure for the relief of debtors.<a
id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
What rules the nine thousand remaining citizens adopted for their
new constitution, we do not know. Whatever they did, must now
have been subject to the consent of Antipater and the Macedonian
garrison, which entered Munychia, under the command of Menyllus,
on the twentieth day of the month Boedromion (September), rather
more than a month after the battle of Krannon. The day of its entry
presented a sorrowful contrast. It was the day on which, during
the annual ceremony of the mysteries of Eleusinian Demeter, the
multitudinous festal procession of citizens escorted the god Iacchus
from Athens to Eleusis.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772"
class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>One of the earliest measures of the nine thousand was, to condemn
to death, at the motion of Demades, the distinguished anti-Macedonian
orators who had already fled—Demosthenes, Hyperides, Aristonikus, and
Himeræus, brother of the citizen afterwards celebrated as Demetrius
the Phalerean. The three last having taken refuge in Ægina, and
Demosthenes in Kalauria, all of them were out of the reach of an
Athenian sentence, but not beyond that of the Macedonian sword.
At this miserable season, Greece was full of similar exiles, the
anti-Macedonian leaders out of all the cities which had taken part in
the Lamian war. The officers of Antipater, called in the language of
the time the Exile-Hunters,<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773"
class="fnanchor">[773]</a> were everywhere on the look-out to seize
these proscribed men; many of the orators, from other cities as
well as from Athens, were slain; and there was no refuge except
the mountains of Ætolia for any of them.<a id="FNanchor_774"
href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> One of these
officers, a Thurian named Archias, who had once been a tragic
actor, passed over with a company of Thracian soldiers to Ægi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span>na, where he seized the
three Athenian orators—Hyperides, Aristonikus, and Himeræus—dragging
them out of the sanctuary of the Æakeion or chapel of Æakus. They
were all sent as prisoners to Antipater, who had by this time marched
forward with his army to Corinth and Kleonæ in Peloponnesus. All
were there put to death, by his order. It is even said, and on
respectable authority, that the tongue of Hyperides was cut out
before he was slain; according to another statement, he himself bit
it out—being put to the torture, and resolving to make revelation of
secrets impossible. Respecting the details of his death, there were
several different stories.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775"
class="fnanchor">[775]</a></p>

<p>Having conducted these prisoners to Antipater, Archias proceeded
with his Thracians to Kalauria in search of Demosthenes. The temple
of Poseidon there situated, in which the orator had taken sanctuary,
was held in such high veneration, that Archias, hesitating to drag
him out by force, tried to persuade him to come forth voluntarily,
under promise that he should suffer no harm. But Demosthenes,
well aware of the fate which awaited him, swallowed poison in the
temple, and when the dose was beginning to take effect, came out
of the sacred ground, expiring immediately after he had passed
the boundary. The accompanying circumstances were recounted in
several different ways.<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776"
class="fnanchor">[776]</a> Eratosthenes (to whose authority I lean)
affirmed that Demosthenes carried the poison in a ring round his arm;
others said that it was suspended in a linen bag round his neck;
according to a third story, it was contained in a writing-quill,
which he was seen to bite and suck, while composing a last letter to
Antipater. Amidst these contradictory details, we can only affirm
as certain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span>
that the poison which he had provided beforehand preserved him
from the sword of Antipater, and perhaps from having his tongue
cut out. The most remarkable assertion was that of Demochares,
nephew of Demosthenes, made in his harangues at Athens a few years
afterwards. Demochares asserted that his uncle had not taken
poison, but had been softly withdrawn from the world by a special
providence of the gods, just at the moment essential to rescue him
from the cruelty of the Macedonians. It is not less to be noted, as
an illustration of the vein of sentiment afterwards prevalent, that
Archias the Exile-Hunter was affirmed to have perished in the utmost
dishonor and wretchedness.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777"
class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>The violent deaths of these illustrious orators, the
disfranchisement and deportation of the Athenian Demos, the
suppression of the public Dikasteries, the occupation of Athens
by a Macedonian garrison, and of Greece generally by Macedonian
Exile-Hunters—are events belonging to one and the same calamitous
tragedy, and marking the extinction of the autonomous hellenic
world. Of Hyperides as a citizen we know only the general fact,
that he maintained from first to last, and with oratorical ability
inferior only to Demosthenes, a strenuous opposition to Macedonian
dominion over Greece; though his prosecution of Demosthenes
respecting the Harpalian treasure appears (as far as it comes before
us) discreditable. Of Demosthenes we know more—enough to form a
judgment of him both as citizen and statesman. At the time of his
death he was about sixty-two years of age, and we have before
us his first Philippic, delivered thirty years before (352-351
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). We are thus sure, that even at that
early day, he took a sagacious and provident measure of the danger
which threatened Grecian liberty from the energy and encroachments
of Philip. He impressed upon his countrymen this coming danger, at
a time when the older and more influential politicians either could
not or would not see it; he called aloud upon his fellow-citizens
for personal service and pecuniary contributions, enforcing
the call by all the artifices of consummate oratory, when such
distasteful propositions only entailed unpopu<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span>larity upon himself. At the period
when Demosthenes first addressed these earnest appeals to his
countrymen, long before the fall of Olynthus, the power of Philip,
though formidable, might have been kept perfectly well within the
limits of Macedonia and Thrace; and would probably have been so kept,
had Demosthenes possessed in 351 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> as much
public influence as he had acquired ten years afterwards, in 341
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>Throughout the whole career of Demosthenes as a public adviser,
down to the battle of Chæroneia, we trace the same combination of
earnest patriotism with wise and long-sighted policy. During the
three years’ war which ended with the battle of Chæroneia, the
Athenians in the main followed his counsel; and disastrous as were
the ultimate military results of that war, for which Demosthenes
could not be responsible—its earlier periods were creditable and
successful, its general scheme was the best that the case admitted,
and its diplomatic management universally triumphant. But what
invests the purposes and policy of Demosthenes with peculiar
grandeur, is, that they were not simply Athenian, but in an eminent
degree Panhellenic also. It was not Athens only that he sought to
defend against Philip, but the whole hellenic world. In this he
towers above the greatest of his predecessors for half a century
before his birth—Perikles, Archidamus, Agesilaus, Epaminondas;
whose policy was Athenian, Spartan, Theban, rather than hellenic.
He carries us back to the time of the invasion of Xerxes and the
generation immediately succeeding it, when the struggles and
sufferings of the Athenians against Persia were consecrated by
complete identity of interest with collective Greece. The sentiments
to which Demosthenes appeals throughout his numerous orations, are
those of the noblest and largest patriotism; trying to inflame the
ancient Grecian sentiment, of an autonomous hellenic world, as the
indispensable condition of a dignified and desirable existence<a
id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>—but
inculcating at the same time that these blessings could only
be preserved by toil, self-sacrifice, devotion of fortune, and
willingness to brave hard and steady personal service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span>From the
destruction of Thebes by Alexander in 335 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
to the Lamian war after his death, the policy of Athens neither
was nor could be conducted by Demosthenes. But, condemned as he
was to comparative inefficacy, he yet rendered material service to
Athens, in the Harpalian affair of 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
If, instead of opposing the alliance of the city with Harpalus, he
had supported it as warmly as Hyperides—the exaggerated promises of
the exile might probably have prevailed, and war would have been
declared against Alexander. In respect to the charge of having been
corrupted by Harpalus, I have already shown reasons for believing
him innocent. The Lamian war, the closing scene of his activity,
was not of his original suggestion, since he was in exile at its
commencement. But he threw himself into it with unreserved ardor,
and was greatly instrumental in procuring the large number of
adhesions which it obtained from so many Grecian states. In spite
of its disastrous result, it was, like the battle of Chæroneia, a
glorious effort for the recovery of Grecian liberty, undertaken under
circumstances which promised a fair chance of success. There was no
excessive rashness in calculating on distractions in the empire left
by Alexander—on mutual hostility among the principal officers—and on
the probability of having only to make head against Antipater and
Macedonia, with little or no reinforcement from Asia. Disastrous as
the enterprise ultimately proved, yet the risk was one fairly worth
incurring, with so noble an object at stake; and could the war have
been protracted another year, its termination would probably have
been very different. We shall see this presently when we come to
follow Asiatic events. After a catastrophe so ruinous, extinguishing
free speech in Greece, and dispersing the Athenian Demos to distant
lands, Demosthenes himself could hardly have desired, at the age of
sixty-two, to prolong his existence as a fugitive beyond sea.</p>

<p>Of the speeches which he composed for private litigants,
occasionally also for himself, before the Dikastery—and of the
numerous stimulating and admonitory harangues on the public affairs
of the moment, which he had addressed to his assembled countrymen, a
few remain for the admiration of posterity. These harangues serve to
us, not only as evidence of his unrivalled ex<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span>cellence as an orator, but as one of the
chief sources from which we are enabled to appreciate the last phase
of free Grecian life, as an acting and working reality.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XCVI.<br />
    FROM THE LAMIAN WAR TO THE CLOSE OF THE HISTORY OF
    FREE HELLAS AND HELLENISM.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">The</span> death of Demosthenes,
with its tragical circumstances recounted in my last chapter, is on
the whole less melancholy than the prolonged life of Phokion, as
agent of Macedonian supremacy in a city half-depopulated, where he
had been born a free citizen, and which he had so long helped to
administer as a free community. The dishonor of Phokion’s position
must have been aggravated by the distress in Athens, arising both
out of the violent deportation of one-half of its free citizens, and
out of the compulsory return of the Athenian settlers from Samos;
which island was now taken from Athens, after she had occupied it
forty-three years, and restored to the Samian people and to their
recalled exiles, by a rescript of Perdikkas in the name of Aridæus.<a
id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
Occupying this obnoxious elevation, Phokion exercised authority
with his usual probity and mildness. Exerting himself to guard the
citizens from being annoyed by disorders on the part of the garrison
of Munychia, he kept up friendly intercourse with its commander
Menyllus, though refusing all presents both<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span> from him and from Antipater. He was
anxious to bestow the gift of citizenship upon the philosopher
Xenokrates, who was only a metic, or resident non-freeman; but
Xenokrates declined the offer, remarking, that he would accept no
place in a constitution against which he had protested as envoy.<a
id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
This mark of courageous independence, not a little remarkable while
the Macedonians were masters of the city, was a tacit reproach to the
pliant submission of Phokion.</p>

<p>Throughout Peloponnesus, Antipater purged and remodelled the
cities, Argos, Megalopolis, and others, as he had done at Athens;
installing in each an oligarchy of his own partisans—sometimes
with a Macedonian garrison—and putting to death, deporting, or
expelling, hostile, or intractable, or democratical citizens.<a
id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>
Having completed the subjugation of Peloponnesus, he passed
across the Corinthian Gulf to attack the Ætolians, now the only
Greeks remaining unsubdued. It was the purpose of Antipater, not
merely to conquer this warlike and rude people, but to transport
them in mass across into Asia, and march them up to the interior
deserts of the empire.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782"
class="fnanchor">[782]</a> His army was too powerful to be resisted
on even ground, so that all the more accessible towns and villages
fell into his hands. But the Ætolians defended themselves bravely,
withdrew their families into the high towns and mountain tops of
their very rugged country, and caused serious loss to the Macedonian
invaders. Nevertheless, Kraterus, who had carried on war of the
same kind with Alexander in Sogdiana, manifested so much skill in
seizing the points of communication, that he intercepted all their
supplies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span> and
reduced them to extreme distress, amidst the winter which had now
supervened. The Ætolians, in spite of bravery and endurance, must
soon have been compelled to surrender from cold and hunger, had
not the unexpected arrival of Antigonus from Asia communicated
such news to Antipater and Kraterus, as induced them to prepare
for marching back to Macedonia, with a view to the crossing of the
Hellespont and operating in Asia. They concluded a pacification
with the Ætolians—postponing till a future period their design of
deporting that people,—and withdrew into Macedonia; where Antipater
cemented his alliance with Kraterus by giving to him his daughter
Phila in marriage.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783"
class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>Another daughter of Antipater, named Nikæa, had been sent over to
Asia not long before, to become the wife of Perdikkas. That general,
acting as guardian or prime minister to the kings of Alexander’s
family (who are now spoken of in the plural number, since Roxana had
given birth to a posthumous son, called Alexander, and made king
jointly with Philip Aridæus), had at first sought close combination
with Antipater, demanding his daughter in marriage. But new views
were presently opened to him by the intrigues of the princesses at
Pella (Olympias, with her daughter Kleopatra, widow of the Molossian
Alexander)—who had always been at variance with Antipater, even
throughout the life of Alexander—and Kynanê (daughter of Philip by
an Illyrian mother, and widow of Amyntas, first cousin of Alexander,
but slain by Alexander’s order) with her daughter Eurydikê. It has
been already mentioned that Kleopatra had offered herself in marriage
to Leonnatus, inviting him to come over and occupy the throne of
Macedonia: he had obeyed the call, but had been slain in his first
battle against the Greeks, thus relieving Antipater from a dangerous
rival. The first project of Olympias being thus frustrated, she
had sent to Perdikkas proposing to him a marriage with Kleopatra.
Perdikkas had already pledged himself to the daughter of Antipater;
nevertheless he now debated whether his ambition would not be better
served by breaking his pledge, and accepting the new proposition.
To this step he was advised by Eumenes, his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span> ablest friend and coadjutor, steadily
attached to the interest of the regal family, and withal personally
hated by Antipater. But Alketas, brother of Perdikkas, represented
that it would be hazardous to provoke openly and immediately the
wrath of Antipater. Accordingly Perdikkas resolved to accept Nikæa
for the moment, but to send her away after no long time, and take
Kleopatra; to whom secret assurances from him were conveyed by
Eumenes. Kynanê also (daughter of Philip and widow of his nephew
Amyntas) a warlike and ambitious woman, had brought into Asia her
daughter Eurydikê for the purpose of espousing the king Philip
Aridæus. Being averse to this marriage, and probably instigated by
Olympias also, Perdikkas and Alketas put Kynanê to death. But the
indignation excited among the soldiers by this deed was so furious as
to menace their safety, and they were forced to permit the marriage
of the king with Eurydikê.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784"
class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p>All these intrigues were going on through the summer of 322
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, while the Lamian war was still effectively
prosecuted by the Greeks. About the autumn of the year, Antigonus
(called Monophthalmus), the satrap of Phrygia, detected these secret
intrigues of Perdikkas; who, for that and other reasons, began to
look on him as an enemy, and to plot against his life. Apprised
of his danger, Antigonus made his escape from Asia into Europe
to acquaint Antipater and Kraterus with the hostile manœuvres of
Perdikkas; upon which news, the two generals, immediately abandoning
the Ætolian war, withdrew their army from Greece for the more
important object of counteracting Perdikkas in Asia.</p>

<p>To us, these contests of the Macedonian officers belong only
so far as they affect the Greeks. And we see, by the events just
noticed, how unpropitious to the Greeks were the turns of For<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p. 335]</span>tune, throughout
the Lamian war: the grave of Grecian liberty, not for the actual
combatants only, but for their posterity also.<a id="FNanchor_785"
href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> Until the battle
of Krannon and the surrender of Athens, everything fell out so as
to relieve Antipater from embarrassment, and impart to him double
force. The intrigues of the princesses at Pella, who were well known
to hate him, first raised up Leonnatus, next Perdikkas, against
him. Had Leonnatus lived, the arm of Antipater would have been at
least weakened, if not paralyzed; had Perdikkas declared himself
earlier, the forces of Antipater must have been withdrawn to oppose
him, and the battle of Krannon would probably have had a different
issue. As soon as Perdikkas became hostile to Antipater, it was his
policy to sustain and seek alliance with the Greeks, as we shall
find him presently doing with the Ætolians.<a id="FNanchor_786"
href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Through causes thus
purely accidental, Antipater obtained an interval of a few months,
during which his hands were not only free, but armed with new and
unexpected strength from Leonnatus and Kraterus, to close the Lamian
war. The disastrous issue of that war was therefore in great part
the effect of casualties, among which we must include the death of
Leosthenes himself. Such issue is not to be regarded as proving
that the project was desperate or ill-conceived on the part of its
promoters, who had full right to reckon, among the probabilities of
their case, the effects of discord between the Macedonian chiefs.</p>

<p>In the spring of 321 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Antipater and
Kraterus, having concerted operations with Ptolemy governor of
Egypt, crossed into Asia, and began their conflict with Perdikkas;
who himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span>
having the kings along with him, marched against Egypt to attack
Ptolemy; leaving his brother Alketas, in conjunction with Eumenes as
general, to maintain his cause in Kappadokia and Asia Minor. Alketas,
discouraged by the adverse feeling of the Macedonians generally,
threw up the enterprise as hopeless. But Eumenes, though embarrassed
and menaced in every way by the treacherous jealousy of his own
Macedonian officers, and by the discontent of the soldiers against
him as a Greek—and though compelled to conceal from these soldiers
the fact that Kraterus, who was popular among them, commanded on
the opposite side,—displayed nevertheless so much ability that he
gained an important victory,<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787"
class="fnanchor">[787]</a> in which both Neoptolemus and Kraterus
perished. Neoptolemus was killed by Eumenes with his own hand, after
a personal conflict desperate in the extreme and long doubtful,
and at the cost of a severe wound to himself.<a id="FNanchor_788"
href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> After the victory, he
found Kraterus still alive, though expiring from his wound. Deeply
afflicted at the sight, he did his utmost to restore the dying man;
and when this proved to be impossible, caused his dead body to be
honorably shrouded and transmitted into Macedonia for burial.</p>

<p>This new proof of the military ability and vigor of Eumenes,
together with the death of two such important officers as Kraterus
and Neoptolemus—proved ruinous to the victor himself, without serving
the cause in which he fought. Perdikkas his chief did not live to
hear of it. That general was so overbearing and tyrannical in his
demeanor towards the other officers—and withal so unsuccessful in
his first operations against Ptolemy on the Pelusiac branch of the
Nile—that his own army mutinied and slew him.<a id="FNanchor_789"
href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> His troops joined
Ptolemy, whose concilia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[p.
337]</span>tory behavior gained their goodwill. Only two days
after this revolution, a messenger from Eumenes reached the
camp, announcing his victory and the death of Kraterus. Had this
intelligence been received by Perdikkas himself at the head of his
army, the course of subsequent events might have been sensibly
altered. Eumenes would have occupied the most commanding position
in Asia, as general of the kings of the Alexandrine family, to whom
both his interests and his feelings attached him. But the news,
arriving at the moment when it did, caused throughout the army
only the most violent exasperation against him; not simply as ally
of the odious Perdikkas, but as cause of death to the esteemed
Kraterus. He, together with Alketas and fifty officers, was voted
by the soldiers a public enemy. No measures were kept with him
henceforward by Macedonian officers or soldiers. At the same time
several officers attached to Perdikkas in the camp, and also Atalanta
his sister, were slain.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790"
class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>By the death of Perdikkas, and the defection of his soldiers,
complete preponderance was thrown into the hands of Antipater,
Ptolemy, and Antigonus. Antipater was invited to join the army,
now consisting of the forces both of Ptolemy and Perdikkas united.
He was there invested with the guardianship of the persons of the
kings, and with the sort of ministerial supremacy previously held by
Perdikkas. He was however exposed to much difficulty, and even to
great personal danger, from the intrigues of the princess Eurydikê,
who displayed a masculine boldness in publicly haranguing the
soldiers—and from the discontents of the army, who claimed presents,
formerly promised to them by Alexander, which there were no funds
to liquidate at the moment. At Triparadisus in Syria, Antipater
made a second distribution of the satrapies of the empire; somewhat
modified, yet coinciding in the main with that which had been drawn
up shortly after the death of Alexander. To Ptolemy was assured Egypt
and Libya,—to Antigonus, the Greater Phrygia, Lykia, and Pamphylia—as
each had had before.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791"
class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p>Antigonus was placed in command of the principal Macedon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>ian army in Asia, to
crush Eumenes and the other chief adherents of Perdikkas; most of
whom had been condemned to death by a vote of the Macedonian army.
After a certain interval, Antipater himself, accompanied by the
kings, returned to Macedonia, having eluded by artifice a renewed
demand on the part of his soldiers for the promised presents.
The war of Antigonus, first against Eumenes in Kappadokia, next
against Alketas and the other partisans of Perdikkas in Pisidia,
lasted for many months, but was at length successfully finished.<a
id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>
Eumenes, beset by the constant treachery and insubordination of
the Macedonians, was defeated and driven out of the field. He took
refuge with a handful of men in the impregnable and well-stored
fortress of Nora in Kappadokia, where he held out a long blockade,
apparently more than a year, against Antigonus.<a id="FNanchor_793"
href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>Before the prolonged blockade of Nora had been brought to a
close, Antipater, being of very advanced age, fell into sickness,
and presently died. One of his latest acts was, to put to death the
Athenian orator Demades, who had been sent to Macedonia as envoy to
solicit the removal of the Macedonian garrison at Munychia. Antipater
had promised, or given hopes, that if the oligarchy which he had
constituted at Athens maintained unshaken adherence to Macedonia, he
would withdraw the garrison. The Athenians endeavored to prevail on
Phokion to go to Macedonia as solicitor for the fulfilment of this
promise; but he steadily refused. Demades, who willingly undertook
the mission, reached Macedonia at a moment very untoward for himself.
The papers of the deceased Perdikkas had come into possession of his
opponents; and among them had been found a letter written to him
by Demades, inviting him to cross over and rescue Greece from her
dependence “on an old and rotten warp”—meaning Antipater. This letter
gave great offence to Antipater—the rather, as Demades is said to
have been his habitual pensioner—and still greater offence to his
son Kassander; who caused Demades with his son to be seized—first
killed the son<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> in
the immediate presence and even embrace of the father—and then slew
the father himself, with bitter invective against his ingratitude.<a
id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> All
the accounts which we read depict Demades, in general terms, as a
prodigal spendthrift and a venal and corrupt politician. We have no
ground for questioning this statement: at the same time, we have no
specific facts to prove it.</p>

<p>Antipater by his last directions appointed Polysperchon, one
of Alexander’s veteran officers, to be chief administrator, with
full powers on behalf of the imperial dynasty; while he assigned
to his own son Kassander only the second place, as Chiliarch, or
general of the body-guard.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795"
class="fnanchor">[795]</a> He thought that this disposition of
power would be more generally acceptable throughout the empire,
as Polysperchon was older and of longer military service than any
other among Alexander’s generals. Moreover, Antipater was especially
afraid of letting dominion fall into the hands of the princesses;<a
id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> all
of whom—Olympias, Kleopatra, and Eurydikê—were energetic characters;
and the first of the three (who had retired to Epirus from enmity
towards Antipater) furious and implacable.</p>

<p>But the views of Antipater were disappointed from the beginning,
because Kassander would not submit to the second place, nor tolerate
Polysperchon as his superior. Immediately after the death of
Antipater, but before it became publicly known, Kassander despatched
Nikanor with pretended orders from Antipater to supersede Menyllus in
the government of Munychia. To this order Menyllus yielded. But when
after a few days the Athenian public came to learn the real truth,
they were displeased with Phokion for having permitted the change
to be made—assuming that he knew the real state of the facts,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span> and might have kept
out the new commander.<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797"
class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Kassander, while securing this important
post in the hands of a confirmed partisan, affected to acquiesce
in the authority of Polysperchon, and to occupy himself with a
hunting-party in the country. He at the same time sent confidential
adherents to the Hellespont and other places in furtherance of his
schemes; and especially to contract alliance with Antigonus in
Asia and with Ptolemy in Egypt. His envoys being generally well
received, he himself soon quitted Macedonia suddenly, and went
to concert measures with Antigonus in Asia.<a id="FNanchor_798"
href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> It suited the policy
of Ptolemy, and still more that of Antigonus, to aid him against
Polysperchon and the imperial dynasty. On the death of Antipater,
Antigonus had resolved to make himself the real sovereign of the
Asiatic Alexandrine empire, possessing as he did the most powerful
military force within it.</p>

<p>Even before this time the imperial dynasty had been a name rather
than a reality; yet still a respected name. But now, the preference
shown to Polysperchon by the deceased Antipater, and the secession
of Kassander, placed all the real great powers in active hostility
against the dynasty. Polysperchon and his friends were not blind
to the difficulties of their position. The principal officers in
Macedonia having been convened to deliberate, it was resolved to
invite Olympias out of Epirus, that she might assume the tutelage
of her grandson Alexander (son of Roxana)—to place the Asiatic
interests of the dynasty in the hands of Eumenes, appointing him
to the supreme command<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799"
class="fnanchor">[799]</a>—and to combat Kassander in Europe, by
assuring to themselves the general goodwill and support of the
Greeks. This last object was to be obtained by granting to the
Greeks general enfranchisement, and by subverting the Antipatrian
oligarchies and military governments now paramount throughout the
cities.</p>

<p>The last hope of maintaining the unity of Alexander’s empire
in Asia, against the counter-interests of the great Macedonian
officers, who were steadily tending to divide and appropriate it—now
lay in the fidelity and military skill of Eumenes. At his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span> disposal Polysperchon
placed the imperial treasures and soldiers in Asia; especially
the brave, but faithless and disorderly, Argyraspides. Olympias
also addressed to him a pathetic letter, asking his counsel as the
only friend and savior to whom the imperial family could now look.
Eumenes replied by assuring them of his devoted adherence to their
cause. But he at the same time advised Olympias not to come out of
Epirus into Macedonia; or if she did come, at all events to abstain
from vindictive and cruel proceedings. Both these recommendations,
honorable as well to his prudence as to his humanity, were
disregarded by the old queen. She came into Macedonia to take the
management of affairs; and although her imposing title, of mother
to the great conqueror, raised a strong favorable feeling, yet her
multiplied executions of the Antipatrian partisans excited fatal
enmity against a dynasty already tottering. Nevertheless Eumenes,
though his advice had been disregarded, devoted himself in Asia with
unshaken fidelity to the Alexandrine family, resisting the most
tempting invitations to take part with Antigonus against them.<a
id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
His example contributed much to keep alive the same active sentiment
in those around him; indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p.
342]</span> without him, the imperial family would have had no
sincere or commanding representative in Asia. His gallant struggles,
first in Kilikia and Phenicia, next (when driven from the coast),
in Susiana, Persis, Media, and Parætakênê—continued for two years
against the greatly preponderant forces of Ptolemy, Antigonus,
and Seleukus, and against the never-ceasing treachery of his own
officers and troops<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801"
class="fnanchor">[801]</a>—do not belong to Grecian history. They
are however among the most memorable exploits of antiquity. While
even in a military point of view, they are hardly inferior to the
combinations of Alexander himself—they evince, besides, a flexibility
and aptitude such as Alexander neither possessed nor required, for
overcoming the thousand difficulties raised by traitors and mutineers
around him. To the last, Eumenes remained unsubdued; he was betrayed
to Antigonus by the base and venal treachery of his own soldiers, the
Macedonian Argyraspides.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802"
class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>For the interests of the imperial dynasty (the extinction of
which we shall presently follow), it is perhaps to be regretted
that they did not abandon Asia at once, at the death of Antipater,
and concentrate their attention on Macedonia alone, summoning over
Eumenes to aid them. To keep together in unity the vast aggregate of
Asia was manifestly impracticable, even with his consummate ability.
Indeed, we read that Olympias wished for his presence in Europe,
not trusting any one but him as protector of the child Alexander.<a
id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a>
In Macedonia, apart from Asia, Eumenes, if the violent temper of
Olympias had permitted him, might have upheld the dynasty; which,
having at that time a decided interest in conciliating the Greeks,
might probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span>
have sanctioned his sympathies in favor of free Hellenic community.<a
id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>On learning the death of Antipater, most of the Greek cities
had sent envoys to Pella.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805"
class="fnanchor">[805]</a> To all the governments of these cities,
composed as they were of his creatures, it was a matter of the utmost
moment to know what course the new Macedonian authority would adopt.
Polysperchon, persuaded that they would all adhere to Kassander, and
that his only chance of combating that rival was by enlisting popular
sympathy and interests in Greece, or at least by subverting these
Antipatrian oligarchies—drew up in conjunction with his counsellors a
proclamation which he issued in the name of the dynasty.</p>

<p>After reciting the steady goodwill of Philip and Alexander towards
Greece, he affirmed that this feeling had been interrupted by the
untoward Lamian war, originating with some ill-judged Greeks, and
ending in the infliction of many severe calamities upon the various
cities. But all these severities (he continued) had proceeded from
the generals (Antipater and Kraterus): the kings had now determined
to redress them. It was accordingly proclaimed that the political
constitution of each city should be restored, as it had stood in
the times of Philip and Alexander; that before the thirtieth of the
month Xanthikus, all those who had been condemned to banishment, or
deported, by the generals, should be recalled and received back; that
their properties should be restored, and past sentences against them
rescinded; that they should live in amnesty as to the past, and good
feeling as to the future, with the remaining citizens. From this act
of recall were excluded, the exiles of Amphissa, Trikka, Pharkadon,
and Herakleia, together with a certain number of Megalopolitans,
implicated in one particular conspiracy. In the particular case of
those cities, the governments of which had been denounced as hostile
by Philip or Alexander, special reference and consultation was
opened with Pella, for some modification to meet the circumstances.
As to Athens, it was decreed that Samos should be restored to her,
but not Orôpus; in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p.
344]</span> other respects, she was placed on the same footing as in
the days of Philip and Alexander. “All the Greeks (concluded this
proclamation) shall pass decrees, forbidding every one either to bear
arms or otherwise act in hostility against us—on pain of exile and
confiscation of goods, for himself and his family. On this and on all
other matters, we have ordered Polysperchon to take proper measures.
Obey him—as we have before written you to do; for we shall not omit
to notice those who on any point disregard our proclamation.”<a
id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>Such was the new edict issued by the kings, or rather by
Polysperchon in their names. It directed the removal of all the
garrisons, and the subversion of all the oligarchies, established
by Antipater after the Lamian war. It ordered the recall of the
host of exiles then expelled. It revived the state of things
prevalent before the death of Alexander—which indeed itself had
been, for the most part, an aggregate of macedonizing oligarchies
interspersed with Macedonian garrisons. To the existing Antipatrian
oligarchies, however, it was a deathblow; and so it must have been
understood by the Grecian envoys—including probably deputations
from the exiles, as well as envoys from the civic governments—to
whom Polysperchon delivered it at Pella. Not content with the
general edict, Polysperchon addressed special letters to Argos
and various other cities, commanding that the Antipatrian leading
men should be banished with confiscation of property, and in some
cases put to death;<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807"
class="fnanchor">[807]</a> the names being probably furnished to him
by the exiles. Lastly, as it was clear that such stringent measures
could not be executed without force,—the rather as these oligarchies
would be upheld by Kassander from without—Polysperchon resolved
to conduct a large military force into Greece; sending thither
first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span> however,
a considerable detachment, for immediate operations, under his son
Alexander.</p>

<p>To Athens, as well as to other cities, Polysperchon addressed
special letters, promising restoration of the democracy and recall
of the exiles. At Athens, such change was a greater revolution than
elsewhere, because the multitude of exiles and persons deported had
been the greatest. To the existing nine thousand Athenian citizens,
it was doubtless odious and alarming; while to Phokion with the
other leading Antipatrians, it threatened not only loss of power,
but probably nothing less than the alternative of flight or death.<a
id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>
The state of interests at Athens, however, was now singularly novel
and complicated. There were the Antipatrians and the nine thousand
qualified citizens. There were the exiles, who, under the new edict,
speedily began re-entering the city, and reclaiming their citizenship
as well as their properties. Polysperchon and his son were known to
be soon coming with a powerful force. Lastly, there was Nikanor, who
held Munychia with a garrison, neither for Polysperchon, nor for the
Athenians, but for Kassander; the latter being himself also expected
with a force from Asia. Here then were several parties; each distinct
in views and interests from the rest—some decidedly hostile to each
other.</p>

<p>The first contest arose between the Athenians and Nikanor
respecting Munychia; which they required him to evacuate, pursuant
to the recent proclamation. Nikanor on his side returned an evasive
answer, promising compliance as soon as circumstances permitted, but
in the mean time entreating the Athenians to continue in alliance
with Kassander, as they had been with his father Antipater.<a
id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
He seems to have indulged hopes of prevailing on them to declare in
his favor—and not without plausible grounds, since the Antipatrian
leaders and a proportion of the nine thousand citizens could not
but dread the execution of Polysperchon’s edict. And he had also
what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span> of
still greater moment—the secret connivance and support of Phokion:
who put himself in intimate relation with Nikanor, as he had
before done with Menyllus<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810"
class="fnanchor">[810]</a>—and who had greater reason than any one
else to dread the edict of Polysperchon. At a public assembly held
in Peiræus to discuss the subject, Nikanor even ventured to present
himself in person, in the company and under the introduction of
Phokion, who was anxious that the Athenians should entertain the
proposition of alliance with Kassander. But with the people, the
prominent wish was to get rid altogether of the foreign garrison,
and to procure the evacuation of Munychia—for which object, of
course, the returned exiles would be even more anxious than the
nine thousand. Accordingly, the assembly refused to hear any
propositions from Nikanor; while Derkyllus with others even proposed
to seize his person. It was Phokion who ensured to him the means of
escaping; even in spite of serious wrath from his fellow-citizens,
to whom he pleaded, that he had made himself guarantee for
Nikanor’s personal safety.<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811"
class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>Foreseeing the gravity of the impending contest, Nikanor had been
secretly introducing fresh soldiers into Munychia. And when he found
that he could not obtain any declared support from the Athenians,
he laid a scheme for surprising and occupying the town and harbor
of Peiræus, of which Munychia formed the adjoining eminence and
harbor, on the southern side of the little peninsula. Notwithstanding
all his precautions, it became known to various Athenians that he
was tampering with persons in Peiræus, and collecting troops in
the neighboring isle of Salamis. So much anxiety was expressed in
the Athenian assembly for the safety of Peiræus, that a decree
was passed, enjoining all citizens to hold themselves in arms for
its protection, under Phokion as general. Nevertheless Phokion,
disregarding such a decree, took no precautions, affirming that he
would himself be answerable for Nikanor. Presently that officer,
making an unexpected attack from Munychia and Salamis, took Peiræus
by surprise, placed both the town and harbor under military
occupation, and cut off its communication with Athens by a ditch and
palisade. On this palpable aggression, the Athenians rushed to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span> arms. But Phokion as
general damped their ardor, and even declined to head them in an
attack for the recovery of Peiræus before Nikanor should have had
time to strengthen himself in it. He went however, with Konon (son
of Timotheus), to remonstrate with Nikanor, and to renew the demand
that he should evacuate, under the recent proclamation, all the posts
which he held in garrison. But Nikanor would give no other answer,
except that he held his commission from Kassander, to whom they must
address their application.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812"
class="fnanchor">[812]</a> He thus again tried to bring Athens into
communication with Kassander.</p>

<p>The occupation of Peiræus in addition to Munychia was a serious
calamity to the Athenians, making them worse off than they had
been even under Antipater. Peiræus, rich, active, and commercial,
containing the Athenian arsenal, docks, and muniments of war, was
in many respects more valuable than Athens itself; for all purposes
of war, far more valuable. Kassander had now an excellent place of
arms and base, which Munychia alone would not have afforded, for his
operations in Greece against Polysperchon; upon whom therefore the
loss fell hardly less severely than upon the Athenians. Now Phokion,
in his function as general, had been forewarned of the danger, might
have guarded against it, and ought to have done so. This was a grave
dereliction of duty, and admits of hardly any other explanation
except that of treasonable connivance. It seems that Phokion,
foreseeing his own ruin and that of his friends in the triumph of
Polysperchon and the return of the exiles, was desirous of favoring
the seizure of Peiræus by Nikanor, as a means of constraining Athens
to adopt the alliance with Kassander; which alliance indeed would
probably have been brought about, had Kassander reached Peiræus by
sea sooner than the first troops of Polysperchon by land. Phokion
was here guilty, at the very least, of culpable neglect, and
probably of still more culpable treason, on an occasion seriously
injuring both Polysperchon and the Athenians; a fact which we must
not forget, when we come to read presently the bitter animosity
exhibited against him.<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813"
class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span>The news,
that Nikanor had possessed himself of Peiræus, produced a strong
sensation. Presently arrived a letter addressed to him by Olympias
herself, commanding him to surrender the place to the Athenians,
upon whom she wished to confer entire autonomy. But Nikanor declined
obedience to her order, still waiting for support from Kassander.
The arrival of Alexander (Polysperchon’s son) with a body of
troops, encouraged the Athenians to believe that he was come to
assist in carrying Peiræus by force, for the purpose of restoring
it to them. Their hopes, however, were again disappointed. Though
encamped near Peiræus, Alexander made no demand for the Athenian
forces to co-operate with him in attacking it; but entered into open
parley with Nikanor, whom he endeavored to persuade or corrupt into
surrendering the place.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814"
class="fnanchor">[814]</a> When this negotiation failed, he resolved
to wait for the arrival of his father, who was already on his march
towards Attica with the main army. His own force unassisted was
probably not sufficient to attack Peiræus; nor did he choose to
invoke assistance from the Athenians, to whom he would then have been
compelled to make over the place when taken, which they so ardently
desired. The Athenians were thus as far from their object as ever;
moreover, by this delay the opportunity of attacking the place was
altogether thrown away; for Kassander with his armament reached it
before Polysperchon.</p>

<p>It was Phokion and his immediate colleagues who induced Alexander
to adopt this insidious policy; to decline reconquering Peiræus
for the Athenians, and to appropriate it for himself. To Phokion,
the reconstitution of autonomous Athens, with its democracy and
restored exiles, and without any foreign controlling force—was an
assured sentence of banishment, if not of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span> death. Not having been able to obtain
protection from the foreign force of Nikanor and Kassander, he and
his friends resolved to throw themselves upon that of Alexander
and Polysperchon. They went to meet Alexander as he entered
Attica—represented the impolicy of his relinquishing so important a
military position as Peiræus, while the war was yet unfinished,—and
offered to co-operate with him for this purpose, by proper management
of the Athenian public. Alexander was pleased with these suggestions,
accepted Phokion with the others as his leading adherents at Athens,
and looked upon Peiræus as a capture to be secured for himself.<a
id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>
Numerous returning Athenian exiles accompanied Alexander’s army.
It seems that Phokion was desirous of admitting the troops,
along with the exiles, as friends and allies into the walls of
Athens, so as to make Alexander master of the city—but that this
project was impracticable in consequence of the mistrust created
among the Athenians by the parleys of Alexander with Nikanor.<a
id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<p>The strategic function of Phokion, however, so often conferred
and re-conferred upon him—and his power of doing either good or
evil—now approached its close. As soon as the returning exiles
found themselves in sufficient numbers, they called for a revision
of the list of state-officers, and for the re-establishment of the
democratical forms. They passed a vote to de<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_350">[p. 350]</span>pose those who had held office under
the Antipatrian oligarchy and who still continued to hold it down to
the actual moment. Among these Phokion stood first: along with him
were his son-in-law Charikles, the Phalerean Demetrius, Kallimedon,
Nikokles, Thudippus, Hegemon, and Philokles. These persons were
not only deposed, but condemned, some to death, some to banishment
and confiscation of property. Demetrius, Charikles, and Kallimedon
sought safety by leaving Attica; but Phokion and the rest merely
went to Alexander’s camp, throwing themselves upon his protection
on the faith of the recent understanding.<a id="FNanchor_817"
href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Alexander not only
received them courteously, but gave them letters to his father
Polysperchon, requesting safety and protection for them, as men
who had embraced his cause, and who were still eager to do all in
their power to support him.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818"
class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Armed with these letters, Phokion and his
companions went through Bœotia and Phokis to meet Polysperchon on his
march southward. They were accompanied by Deinarchus and by a Platæan
named Solon, both of them passing for friends of Polysperchon.<a
id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<p>The Athenian democracy, just reconstituted, which had passed the
recent condemnatory votes, was disquieted at the news that Alexander
had espoused the cause of Phokion and had recommended the like policy
to his father. It was possible that Polysperchon might seek, with
his powerful army, both to occupy Athens and to capture Peiræus, and
might avail himself of Phokion (like Antipater after the Lamian war)
as a convenient instrument of government. It seems plain that this
was the project of Alexander, and that he counted on Phokion as a
ready auxiliary in both. Now the restored democrats, though owing
their restoration to Polysperchon, were much less compliant towards
him than Phokion had been. Not only they would<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span> not admit him into the city, but they
would not even acquiesce in his separate occupation of Munychia and
Peiræus. On the proposition of Agnonides and Archestratus, they
sent a deputation to Polysperchon accusing Phokion and his comrades
of high treason; yet at the same time claiming for Athens the full
and undiminished benefit of the late regal proclamation—autonomy
and democracy, with restoration of Peiræus and Munychia free
and ungarrisoned.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820"
class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p>The deputation reached Polysperchon at Pharyges in Phokis, as
early as Phokion’s company, which had been detained for some days at
Elateia by the sickness of Deinarchus. That delay was unfortunate
for Phokion. Had he seen Polysperchon, and presented the letter of
Alexander, before the Athenian accusers arrived, he might probably
have obtained a more favorable reception. But as the arrival of
the two parties was nearly simultaneous, Polysperchon heard both
of them at the same audience, before King Philip Aridæus in his
throne with the gilt ceiling above it. When Agnonides,—chief of the
Athenian deputation, and formerly friend and advocate of Demosthenes
in the Harpalian cause—found himself face to face with Phokion and
his friends, their reciprocal invectives at first produced nothing
but confusion; until Agnonides himself exclaimed—“Pack us all into
one cage and send us back to Athens to receive judgment from the
Athenians.” The king laughed at this observation, but the bystanders
around insisted upon more orderly proceedings, and Agnonides then set
forth the two demands of the Athenians—condemnation of Phokion and
his friends, partly as accomplices of Antipater, partly as having
betrayed Peiræus to Nikanor—and the full benefit of the late regal
proclamation to Athens.<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821"
class="fnanchor">[821]</a> Now, on the last of these two<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span> heads, Polysperchon was
noway disposed to yield—nor to hand over Peiræus to the Athenians
as soon as he should take it. On this matter, accordingly, he
replied by refusal or evasion. But he was all the more disposed to
satisfy the Athenians on the other matter—the surrender of Phokion;
especially as the sentiment now prevalent at Athens evinced clearly
that Phokion could not be again useful to him as an instrument.
Thus disposed to sacrifice Phokion, Polysperchon heard his defence
with impatience, interrupted him several times, and so disgusted
him, that he at length struck the ground with his stick, and held
his peace. Hegemon, another of the accused, was yet more harshly
treated. When he appealed to Polysperchon himself, as having been
personally cognizant of his (the speaker’s) good dispositions
towards the Athenian people (he had probably been sent to Pella, as
envoy for redress of grievances under the Antipatrian oligarchy),
Polysperchon exclaimed—“Do not utter falsehoods against me before the
king.” Moreover, king Philip himself was so incensed, as to start
from his throne and snatch his spear; with which he would have run
Hegemon through,—imitating the worst impulses of his illustrious
brother—had he not been held back by Polysperchon. The sentence could
not be doubtful. Phokion and his companions were delivered over as
prisoners to the Athenian deputation, together with a letter from
the king, intimating that in his conviction they were traitors,
but that he left them to be judged by the Athenians, now restored
to freedom and autonomy.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822"
class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>The Macedonian Kleitus was instructed to convey them to Athens as
prisoners under a guard. Mournful was the spectacle as they entered
the city; being carried along the Kerameikus in carts, through
sympathizing friends and an embittered multitude, until they reached
the theatre, wherein the assembly was to be convened. That assembly
was composed of every one who chose to enter, and is said to have
contained many foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[p.
353]</span>ers and slaves. But it would have been fortunate for
Phokion had such really been the case; for foreigners and slaves had
no cause of antipathy towards him. The assembly was mainly composed
of Phokion’s keenest enemies, the citizens just returned from exile
or deportation; among whom may doubtless have been intermixed more
or less of non-qualified persons, since the lists had probably not
yet been verified. When the assembly was about to be opened, the
friends of Phokion moved, that on occasion of so important a trial,
foreigners and slaves should be sent away. This was in every sense an
impolitic proceeding; for the restored exiles, chiefly poor men, took
it as an insult to themselves, and became only the more embittered,
exclaiming against the oligarchs who were trying to exclude them.</p>

<p>It is not easy to conceive stronger grounds of exasperation than
those which inflamed the bosoms of these returned exiles. We must
recollect that at the close of the Lamian war, the Athenian democracy
had been forcibly subverted. Demosthenes and its principal leaders
had been slain, some of them with antecedent cruelties; the poorer
multitude, in number more than half of the qualified citizens,
had been banished or deported into distant regions. To all the
public shame and calamity, there was thus superadded a vast mass
of individual suffering and impoverishment, the mischiefs of which
were very imperfectly healed, even by that unexpected contingency
which had again thrown open to them their native city. Accordingly,
when these men returned from different regions, each hearing from
the rest new tales of past hardship, they felt the bitterest hatred
against the authors of the Antipatrian revolution; and among these
authors Phokion stood distinctly marked. For although he had neither
originated nor advised these severities, yet he and his friends,
as administering the Antipatrian government at Athens, must have
been agents in carrying them out, and had rendered themselves
distinctly liable to the fearful penalties pronounced by the
psephism of Demophantus,<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823"
class="fnanchor">[823]</a> consecrated by an oath taken by Athenians
generally, against any one who should hold an official post after the
government was subverted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span>When these
restored citizens thus saw Phokion brought before them, for the
first time after their return, the common feeling of antipathy
against him burst out into furious manifestations. Agnonides the
principal accuser, supported by Epikurus<a id="FNanchor_824"
href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> and Demophilus,
found their denunciations welcomed and even anticipated, when
they arraigned Phokion as a criminal who had lent his hand to the
subversion of the constitution,—to the sufferings of his deported
fellow-citizens,—and to the holding of Athens in subjection
under a foreign potentate; in addition to which, the betrayal
of Peiræus to Nikanor<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825"
class="fnanchor">[825]</a> constituted a new crime; fastening on the
people the yoke of Kassander, when autonomy had been promised to them
by the recent imperial edict. After the accusation was concluded,
Phokion was called on for his defence; but he found it impossible
to obtain a hearing. Attempting several times to speak, he was as
often interrupted by angry shouts; several of his friends were cried
down in like manner; until at length he gave up the case in despair,
and exclaimed, “For myself, Athenians, I plead guilty; I pronounce
against myself the sentence of death for my political conduct; but
why are you to sentence these men near me, who are not guilty?”
“Because they are your friends, Phokion”—was the exclamation of those
around. Phokion then said no more; while Agnonides proposed a decree,
to the effect, that the assembled people should decide by show of
hands, whether the persons now arraigned were guilty or not; and that
if declared guilty, they should be put to death. Some persons present
cried out, that the penalty of torture ought to precede death; but
this savage proposition, utterly at variance with Athenian law in
respect to citizens, was repudiated not less by Agnonides than by
the Macedonian officer Kleitus. The decree was then passed; after
which the show of hands was called for. Nearly every hand in the
assembly was held up in condemnation; each man even rose from his
seat to make the effect more imposing; and some went so far as to
put on wreaths in token of triumph. To many of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span> them doubtless, the gratification
of this intense and unanimous vindictive impulse,—in their view
not merely legitimate, but patriotic,—must have been among the
happiest moments of life.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826"
class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>After sentence, the five condemned persons, Phokion, Nikokles,
Thudippus, Hegemon, and Pythokles, were consigned to the supreme
magistrates of Police, called The Eleven, and led to prison for the
purpose of having the customary dose of poison administered. Hostile
bystanders ran alongside, taunting and reviling them. It is even said
that one man planted himself in the front, and spat upon Phokion; who
turned to the public officers and exclaimed—“Will no one check this
indecent fellow?” This was the only emotion which he manifested; in
other respects, his tranquillity and self-possession were resolutely
maintained, during this soul-subduing march from the theatre to the
prison, amidst the wailings of his friends, the broken spirit of his
four comrades, and the fiercest demonstrations of antipathy from his
fellow-citizens generally. One ray of comfort presented itself as he
entered the prison. It was the nineteenth of the month Munychion,
the day on which the Athenian Horsemen or Knights (the richest class
in the city, men for the most part of oligarchical sentiments)
celebrated their festal procession with wreaths on their heads in
honor of Zeus. Several of these horsemen halted in passing, took off
their wreaths, and wept as they looked through the gratings of the
prison.</p>

<p>Being asked whether he had anything to tell his son Phokus,
Phokion replied—“I tell him emphatically, not to hold evil memory of
the Athenians.” The draught of hemlock was then administered to all
five—to Phokion last. Having been condemned for treason, they were
not buried in Attica; nor were Phokion’s friends allowed to light
a funeral pile for the burning of his body; which was carried out
of Attica into the Megarid, by a hired agent named Konopion, and
there burnt by fire obtained at Megara. The wife of Phokion, with
her maids, poured libations and marked the spot by a small mound of
earth; she also collected the bones and brought them back to Athens
in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span> bosom,
during the secrecy of night. She buried them near her own domestic
hearth, with this address—“Beloved Hestia, I confide to thee these
relics of a good man. Restore them to his own family vault, as soon
as the Athenians shall come to their senses.”<a id="FNanchor_827"
href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p>After a short time (we are told by Plutarch) the Athenians did
thus come to their senses. They discovered that Phokion had been
a faithful and excellent public servant, repented of their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span> severity towards him,
celebrated his funeral obsequies at the public expense, erected a
statue in his honor, and put to death Agnonides by public judicial
sentence; while Epikurus and Demophilus fled from the city and were
slain by Phokion’s son.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828"
class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>These facts are ostensibly correct; but Plutarch omits to notice
the real explanation of them. Within two or three months after
the death of Phokion, Kassander, already in possession of Peiræus
and Munychia, became also master of Athens; the oligarchical or
Phokionic party again acquired predominance; Demetrius the Phalerean
was recalled from exile, and placed to administer the city under
Kassander, as Phokion had administered it under Antipater.</p>

<p>No wonder, that under such circumstances, the memory of Phokion
should be honored. But this is a very different thing from
spontaneous change of popular opinion respecting him. I see no reason
why such change of opinion should have occurred, nor do I believe
that it did occur. The Demos of Athens, banished and deported in
mass, had the best ground for hating Phokion, and were not likely
to become ashamed of the feeling. Though he was personally mild and
incorruptible, they derived no benefit from these virtues. To them
it was of little moment that he should steadily refuse all presents
from Antipater, when he did Antipater’s work gratuitously. Considered
as a judicial trial, the last scene of Phokion before the people in
the theatre is nothing better than a cruel imposture; considered as a
manifestation of public opinion already settled, it is one for which
the facts of the past supplied ample warrant.</p>

<p>We cannot indeed read without painful sympathy the narrative of
an old man above eighty,—personally brave, mild, and superior to
all pecuniary temptation, so far as his positive administration was
concerned,—perishing under an intense and crushing storm of popular
execration. But when we look at the whole case—when we survey,
not merely the details of Phokion’s administration, but the grand
public objects which those details subserved, and towards which he
conducted his fellow-citizens—we shall see that this judgment is
fully merited. In Phokion’s patriotism—for so doubtless he himself
sincerely conceived it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p.
358]</span>—no account was taken of Athenian independence; of the
autonomy or self-management of the Hellenic world; of the conditions,
in reference to foreign kings, under which alone such autonomy could
exist. He had neither the Panhellenic sentiment of Aristeides,
Kallikratidas, and Demosthenes—nor the narrower Athenian sentiment,
like the devotion of Agesilaus to Sparta, and of Epaminondas to
Thebes. To Phokion it was indifferent whether Greece was an aggregate
of autonomous cities, with Athens as first or second among them—or
one of the satrapies under the Macedonian kings. Now this was among
the most fatal defects of a Grecian public man. The sentiment in
which Phokion was wanting, lay at the bottom of all those splendid
achievements which have given to Greece a substantive and pre-eminent
place in the history of the world. Had Themistokles, Arsiteides, and
Leonidas resembled him, Greece would have passed quietly under the
dominion of Persia, and the brilliant, though checkered, century
and more of independent politics which succeeded the repulse of
Xerxes would never have occurred. It was precisely during the fifty
years of Phokion’s political and military influence, that the Greeks
were degraded from a state of freedom, and Athens from ascendency
as well as freedom, into absolute servitude. Insofar as this great
public misfortune can be imputed to any one man—to no one was it
more ascribable than to Phokion. He was stratêgus during most of
the long series of years when Philip’s power was growing; it was
his duty to look ahead for the safety of his countrymen, and to
combat the yet immature giant. He heard the warnings of Demosthenes,
and he possessed exactly those qualities which were wanting to
Demosthenes—military energy and aptitude. Had he lent his influence
to inform the short-sightedness, to stimulate the inertia, to direct
the armed efforts, of his countrymen, the kings of Macedon might
have been kept within their own limits, and the future history of
Greece might have been altogether different. Unfortunately, he took
the opposite side. He acted with Æschines and the Philippizers;
without receiving money from Philip, he did gratuitously all that
Philip desired— by nullifying and sneering down the efforts of
Demosthenes and the other active politicians. After the battle of
Chæroneia, Phokion received from Philip first, and from Alex<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span>ander afterwards, marks
of esteem not shown towards any other Athenian. This was both the
fruit and the proof of his past political action—anti-Hellenic as
well as anti-Athenian. Having done much, in the earlier part of his
life, to promote the subjugation of Greece under the Macedonian
kings, he contributed somewhat, during the latter half, to lighten
the severity of their dominion; and it is the most honorable point
in his character that he always refrained from abusing their marked
favor towards himself, for purposes either of personal gain or of
oppression over his fellow-citizens. Alexander not only wrote letters
to him, even during the plenitude of imperial power, in terms of
respectful friendship, but tendered to him the largest presents—at
one time the sum of 100 talents, at another time the choice of four
towns on the coast of Asia Minor, as Xerxes gave to Themistokles. He
even expressed his displeasure when Phokion, refusing everything,
consented only to request the liberation of three Grecian prisoners
confined at Sardis.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829"
class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>The Lamian war and its consequences, were Phokion’s ruin. He
continued at Athens, throughout that war, freely declaring his
opinion against it; for it is to be remarked, that in spite of his
known macedonizing politics, the people neither banished nor degraded
him, but contented themselves with following the counsels of others.
On the disastrous termination of the war, Phokion undertook the
thankless and dishonorable function of satrap under Antipater at
Athens, with the Macedonian garrison at Munychia to back him. He
became the subordinate agent of a conqueror who not only slaughtered
the chief Athenian orators, but disfranchised and deported the Demos
in mass. Having accepted partnership and responsibility in these
proceedings, Phokion was no longer safe except under the protection
of a foreign prince. After the liberal proclamation issued in the
name of the Macedonian kings, permitting the return of the banished
Demos, he sought safety for himself, first by that treasonable
connivance which enabled Nikanor to seize the Peiræus, next by
courting Polysperchon the enemy of Nikanor. A voluntary expatriation
(along with his friend the Phalerean Demetrius) would have been
less dangerous, and less discreditable, than these manœuvres,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span> which still farther
darkened the close of his life, without averting from him, after
all, the necessity of facing the restored Demos. The intense and
unanimous wrath of the people against him is an instructive, though
a distressing spectacle. It was directed, not against the man or the
administrator—for in both characters Phokion had been blameless,
except as to the last collusion with Nikanor in the seizure of the
Peiræus—but against his public policy. It was the last protest of
extinct Grecian freedom, speaking as it were from the tomb in a
voice of thunder, against that fatal system of mistrust, inertia,
self-seeking, and corruption, which had betrayed the once autonomous
Athens to a foreign conqueror.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that Polysperchon with his army was in
Phokis when Phokion was brought before him, on his march towards
Peloponnesus. Perhaps he may have been detained by negotiation
with the Ætolians, who embraced his alliance.<a id="FNanchor_830"
href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> At any rate he was
tardy in his march, for before he reached Attica, Kassander arrived
at Peiræus to join Nikanor with a fleet of thirty-five ships and 4000
soldiers obtained from Antigonus. On learning this fact, Polysperchon
hastened his march also, and presented himself under the walls of
Athens and Peiræus with a large force of 20,000 Macedonians, 4000
Greek allies, 1000 cavalry, and sixty-five elephants; animals which
were now seen for the first time in European Greece. He at first
besieged Kassander in Peiræus, but finding it difficult to procure
subsistence in Attica for so numerous an army, he marched with
the larger portion into Peloponnesus, leaving his son Alexander
with a division to make head against Kassander. Either approaching
in person the various Peloponnesian towns—or addressing them by
means of envoys—he enjoined the subversion of the Antipatrian
oligarchies, and the restoration of liberty and free speech to the
mass of the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831"
class="fnanchor">[831]</a> In most of the towns, this revolution
was accomplished; but in Megalopolis, the oligarchy held out; not
only forcing Polysperchon to besiege the city, but even defending
it against him successfully. He made two or three attempts to
storm it, by movable towers, by undermining the walls, and even by
the aid of elephants; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p.
361]</span> he was repulsed in all of them,<a id="FNanchor_832"
href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> and obliged to
relinquish the siege with considerable loss of reputation. His
admiral Kleitus was soon afterwards defeated in the Propontis, with
the loss of his whole fleet, by Nikanor (whom Kassander had sent from
Peiræus) and Antigonus.<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833"
class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>After these two defeats, Polysperchon seems to have evacuated
Peloponnesus, and to have carried his forces across the Corinthian
Gulf into Epirus, to join Olympias. His party was greatly weakened
all over Greece, and that of Kassander proportionally strengthened.
The first effect of this was, the surrender of Athens. The Athenians
in the city, including all or many of the restored exiles,
could no longer endure that complete severance from the sea, to
which the occupation of Peiræus and Munychia by Kassander had
reduced them. Athens without a port was hardly tenable; in fact,
Peiræus was considered by its great constructor, Themistokles,
as more indispensable to the Athenians than Athens itself.<a
id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>
The subsistence of the people was derived in large proportion from
imported corn, received through Peiræus; where also the trade and
industrial operations were carried on, most of the revenue collected,
and the arsenals, docks, ships, etc. of the state kept up. It became
evident that Nikanor, by seizing on the Peiræus, had rendered Athens
disarmed and helpless; so that the irreparable mischief done by
Phokion, in conniving at that seizure, was felt more and more every
day. Hence the Athenians, unable to capture the port themselves, and
hopeless of obtaining it through Polysperchon, felt constrained to
listen to the partisans of Kassander, who proposed that terms should
be made with him. It was agreed that they should become friends and
allies of Kassander; that they should have full enjoyment of their
city, with the port Peiræus, their ships and revenues; that the
exiles and deported citizens should be readmitted; that the political
franchise should for the future be enjoyed by all citizens who
possessed 1000 drachmæ of property and upwards; that Kassander should
hold Munychia with a governor and garrison, until the war against
Polysperchon was brought to a close; and that he should also name
some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[p. 362]</span> Athenian
citizen, in whose hands the supreme government of the city should
be vested. Kassander named Demetrius the Phalerean (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> an
Athenian of the Deme Phalerum), one of the colleagues of Phokion;
who had gone into voluntary exile since the death of Antipater, but
had recently returned.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835"
class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>This convention restored substantially at Athens the Antipatrian
government; yet without the severities which had marked its original
establishment—and with some modifications in various ways. It made
Kassander virtually master of the city (as Antipater had been before
him), by means of his governing nominee, upheld by the garrison,
and by the fortification of Munychia; which had now been greatly
enlarged and strengthened,<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836"
class="fnanchor">[836]</a> holding a practical command over Peiræus,
though that port was nominally relinquished to the Athenians.
But there was no slaughter of orators, no expulsion of citizens:
moreover, even the minimum of 1000 drachmæ, fixed for the political
franchise, though excluding the multitude, must have been felt as an
improvement compared with the higher limit of 2000 drachmæ prescribed
by Antipater. Kassander was not, like his father, at the head of an
overwhelming force, master of Greece. He had Polysperchon in the
field against him with a rival army and an established ascendency in
many of the Grecian cities; it was therefore his interest to abstain
from measures of obvious harshness towards the Athenian people.</p>

<p>Towards this end his choice of the Phalerean Demetrius appears
to have been judicious. That citizen continued to administer
Athens, as satrap or despot under Kassander, for ten years. He
was an accomplished literary man, friend both of the philosopher
Theophrastus, who had succeeded to the school of Aristotle—and of the
rhetor Deinarchus. He is described also as a person of expensive and
luxurious habits; towards which he devoted the most of the Athenian
public revenue, 1200 talents in amount, if Duris is to be believed.
His administration is said to have been discreet and moderate. We
know little of its details, but we are told that he made sumptuary
laws, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span>
restricting the cost and ostentation of funerals.<a id="FNanchor_837"
href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> He himself extolled
his own decennial period as one of abundance and flourishing
commerce at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838"
class="fnanchor">[838]</a> But we learn from others, and the fact is
highly probable, that it was a period of distress and humiliation,
both at Athens and in other Grecian towns; and that Athenians, as
well as others, welcomed new projects of colonization (such as that
of Ophellas from Kyrênê) not simply from prospects of advantage,
but also as an escape from existing evils.<a id="FNanchor_839"
href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>What forms of nominal democracy were kept up during this
interval, we cannot discover. The popular judicature must have been
continued for private suits and accusations, since Deinarchus is
said to have been in large practice as a logographer, or composer
of discourses for others.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840"
class="fnanchor">[840]</a> But the fact that three hundred and sixty
statues were erected in honor of Demetrius while his administration
was still going on, demonstrates the gross flattery of his partisans,
the subjection of the people, and the practical abolition of all
free-spoken censure or pronounced opposition. We learn that, in
some one of the ten years of his administration, a census was taken
of the inhabitants of Attica; and that there were numbered, 21,000
citizens, 10,000 metics, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p.
364]</span> 400,000 slaves.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841"
class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Of this important enumeration we know
the bare fact, without its special purpose or even its precise
date.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span> Perhaps
some of those citizens, who had been banished or deported at the
close of the Lamian war, may have returned and continued to reside
at Athens. But there still seems to have remained, during all
the continuance of the Kassandrian Oligarchy, a body of adverse
Athenian exiles, watching for an opportunity of overthrowing it,
and seeking aid for that purpose from the Ætolians and others.<a
id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>The acquisition of Athens by Kassander, followed up by his
capture of Panaktum and Salamis, and seconded by his moderation
towards the Athenians, procured for him considerable support in
Peloponnesus, whither he proceeded with his army.<a id="FNanchor_843"
href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Many of the cities,
intimidated or persuaded, joined him and deserted Polysperchon;
while the Spartans, now feeling for the first time their defenceless
condition, thought it prudent to surround their city with walls.<a
id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
This fact, among many others contemporaneous, testifies emphatically,
how the characteristic sentiments of the Hellenic autonomous world
were now dying out everywhere. The maintenance of Sparta as an
unwalled city, was one of the deepest and most cherished of the
Lykurgean traditions; a standing proof of the fearless bearing and
self-confidence of the Spartans against dangers from without. The
erection of the walls showed their own conviction, but too well borne
out by the real circumstances around them, that the pressure of the
foreigner had become so overwhelming as hardly to leave them even
safety at home.</p>

<p>The warfare between Kassander and Polysperchon became now
embittered by a feud among the members of the Macedonian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[p. 366]</span> imperial family. King
Philip Aridæus and his wife Eurydikê, alarmed and indignant at the
restoration of Olympias which Polysperchon was projecting, solicited
aid from Kassander, and tried to place the force of Macedonia at
his disposal. In this however they failed. Olympias, assisted not
only by Polysperchon, but by the Epirotic prince Æakides, made
her entry into Macedonia out of Epirus, apparently in the autumn
of 317 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> She brought with her Roxana and
her child—the widow and son of Alexander the Great. The Macedonian
soldiers, assembled by Philip Aridæus and Eurydikê to resist her,
were so overawed by her name and the recollection of Alexander, that
they refused to fight, and thus ensured to her an easy victory.
Philip and Eurydikê became her prisoners; the former she caused to be
slain; to the latter she offered only an option between the sword,
the halter, and poison. The old queen next proceeded to satiate
her revenge against the family of Antipater. One hundred leading
Macedonians, friends of Kassander, were put to death, together
with his brother Nikanor;<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845"
class="fnanchor">[845]</a> while the sepulchre of his deceased
brother Iollas, accused of having poisoned Alexander the Great, was
broken up.</p>

<p>During the winter, Olympias remained thus completely predominant
in Macedonia; where her position seemed strong, since her allies the
Ætolians were masters of the pass at Thermopylæ, while Kassander
was kept employed in Peloponnesus by the force under Alexander,
son of Polysperchon. But Kassander, disengaging himself from these
embarrassments, and eluding Thermopylæ by a maritime transit to
Thessaly, seized the Perrhæbian passes before they had been put
under guard, and entered Macedonia without resistance. Olympias,
having no army competent to meet him in the field, was forced to
shut herself up in the maritime fortress of Pydna, with Roxana,
the child Alexander, and Thessalonikê daughter of her late husband
Philip son of Amyntas.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846"
class="fnanchor">[846]</a> Here Kassander blocked her up for several
months by sea, as well as by land, and succeeded in defeating all the
efforts of Polysperchon and Æakides to relieve her. In the spring
of the ensuing year (316 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), she was forced
by intol<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span>erable
famine to surrender. Kassander promised her nothing more than
personal safety, requiring from her the surrender of the two great
fortresses, Pella and Amphipolis, which made him master of Macedonia.
Presently however, the relatives of those numerous victims, who had
perished by order of Olympias, were encouraged by Kassander to demand
her life in retribution. They found little difficulty in obtaining a
verdict of condemnation against her from what was called a Macedonian
assembly. Nevertheless, such was the sentiment of awe and reverence
connected with her name, that no one except these injured men
themselves could be found to execute the sentence. She died with a
courage worthy of her rank and domineering character. Kassander took
Thessalonikê to wife—confined Roxana with the child Alexander in the
fortress of Amphipolis—where (after a certain interval) he caused
both of them to be slain.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847"
class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p>While Kassander was thus master of Macedonia—and while the
imperial family were disappearing from the scene in that country—the
defeat and death of Eumenes (which happened nearly at the same time
as the capture of Olympias<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848"
class="fnanchor">[848]</a>) removed the last faithful partisan of
that family in Asia. But at the same time, it left in the hands of
Antigonus such overwhelming preponderance throughout Asia, that he
aspired to become vicar and master of the entire Alexandrine empire,
as well as to avenge upon Kassander the extirpation of the regal
family. His power appeared indeed so formidable, that Kassander of
Macedonia, Lysimachus of Thrace, Ptolemy of Egypt, and Seleukus of
Babylonia, entered into a convention, which gradually ripened into an
active alliance, against him.</p>

<p>During the struggles between these powerful princes, Greece
appears simply as a group of subject cities, held, garrisoned,
grasped at, or coveted, by all of them. Polysperchon, abandoning all
hopes in Macedonia after the death of Olympias, had been forced to
take refuge among the Ætolians, leaving his son Alexander to make the
best struggle that he could in Peloponnesus;<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span> so that Kassander was now decidedly
preponderant throughout the Hellenic regions. After fixing himself
on the throne of Macedonia, he perpetuated his own name by founding,
on the isthmus of the peninsula of Pallênê and near the site where
Potidæa had stood, the new city of Kassandreia; into which he
congregated a large number of inhabitants from the neighborhood, and
especially the remnant of the citizens of Olynthus and Potidæa,—towns
taken and destroyed by Philip more than thirty years before.<a
id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> He
next marched into Peloponnesus with his army against Alexander son
of Polysperchon. Passing through Bœotia, he undertook the task of
restoring the city of Thebes, which had been destroyed twenty years
previously by Alexander the Great, and had ever since existed only
as a military post on the ancient citadel called Kadmeia. The other
Bœotian towns, to whom the old Theban territory had been assigned,
were persuaded or constrained to relinquish it; and Kassander invited
from all parts of Greece the Theban exiles or their descendants.
From sympathy with these exiles, and also with the ancient celebrity
of the city, many Greeks, even from Italy and Sicily, contributed
to the restoration. The Athenians, now administered by Demetrius
Phalereus under Kassander’s supremacy, were particularly forward
in the work; the Messenians and Megalopolitans, whose ancestors
had owed so much to the Theban Epaminondas, lent strenuous aid.
Thebes was re-established in the original area which it had occupied
before Alexander’s siege; and was held by a Kassandrian garrison
in the Kadmeia, destined for the mastery of Bœotia and Greece.<a
id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>After some stay at Thebes, Kassander advanced toward Peloponnesus.
Alexander (son of Polysperchon) having fortified the Isthmus, he
was forced to embark his troops with his elephants at Megara, and
cross over the Saronic Gulf to Epidaurus. He dispossessed Alexander
of Argos, of Messenia, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p.
369]</span> even of his position on the Isthmus, where he
left a powerful detachment, and then returned to Macedonia.<a
id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> His
increasing power raised both apprehension and hatred in the bosom of
Antigonus, who endeavored to come to terms with him, but in vain.<a
id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
Kassander preferred the alliance with Ptolemy, Seleukus, and
Lysimachus—against Antigonus, who was now master of nearly the whole
of Asia, inspiring common dread to all of them.<a id="FNanchor_853"
href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Accordingly, from
Asia to Peloponnesus, with arms and money Antigonus despatched the
Milesian Aristodemus to strengthen Alexander against Kassander; whom
he further denounced as an enemy of the Macedonian name, because
he had slain Olympias, imprisoned the other members of the regal
family, and re-established the Olynthian exiles. He caused the absent
Kassander to be condemned by what was called a Macedonian assembly,
upon these and other charges.</p>

<p>Antigonus farther proclaimed, by the voice of this assembly,
that all the Greeks should be free, self-governing, and exempt
from garrisons or military occupation.<a id="FNanchor_854"
href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> It was expected that
these brilliant promises would enlist partisans in Greece against
Kassander; accordingly Ptolemy ruler of Egypt, one of the enemies of
Antigonus, thought fit to issue similar proclamations a few months
afterwards, tendering to the Greeks the same boon from himself.<a
id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a>
These promises, neither executed, not intended to be executed, by
either of the kings, appear to have produced little or no effect upon
the Greeks.</p>

<p>The arrival of Aristodemus in Peloponnesus had re-animated the
party of Alexander, (son of Polysperchon), against whom Kassander
was again obliged to bring his full forces from Macedonia. Though
successful against Alexander at Argos, Orchomenus, and other places,
Kassander was not able to crush him, and presently thought it
prudent to gain him over. He offered to him the separate government
of Peloponnesus, though in subordination to himself: Alexander
accepted the offer, becoming Kassander’s ally<a id="FNanchor_856"
href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a>—and carried on war,
jointly with him, against Aristodemus, with varying success, until
he was presently assas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p.
370]</span>sinated by some private enemies. Nevertheless his widow
Kratesipolis, a woman of courage and energy, still maintained
herself in considerable force at Sikyon.<a id="FNanchor_857"
href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> Kassander’s most
obstinate enemies were the Ætolians, of whom we now first hear
formal mention as a substantive confederacy.<a id="FNanchor_858"
href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> These Ætolians became
the allies of Antigonus as they had been before of Polysperchon,
extending their predatory ravages even as far as Attica. Protected
against foreign garrisons, partly by their rude and fierce habits,
partly by their mountainous territory, they were almost the only
Greeks who could still be called free. Kassander tried to keep them
in check through their neighbors the Akarnanians, whom he induced to
adopt a more concentrated habit of residence, consolidating their
numerous petty townships into a few considerable towns,—Stratus,
Sauria, and Agrinium—convenient posts for Macedonian garrisons.
He also made himself master of Leukas, Apollonia, and Epidamnus,
defeating the Illyrian king Glaukias, so that his dominion
now extended across from the Thermaic to the Adriatic Gulf.<a
id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
His general Philippus gained two important victories over the
Ætolians and Epirots, forcing the former to relinquish some of their
most accessible towns.<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860"
class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>The power of Antigonus in Asia underwent a material diminution,
by the successful and permanent establishment which Seleukus now
acquired in Babylonia; from which event the era of the succeeding
Seleukidæ takes its origin. In Greece, however, Antigonus gained
ground on Kassander. He sent thither his nephew Ptolemy with a
large force to liberate the Greeks, or in other words, to expel
the Kassandrian garrisons; while he at the same time distracted
Kassander’s attention by threatening to cross the Hellespont
and invade Macedonia. This Ptolemy (not the Egyptian) expelled
the soldiers of Kassander from Eubœa,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> Bœotia, and Phokis. Chalkis in Eubœa
was at this time the chief military station of Kassander; Thebes
(which he had recently re-established) was in alliance with him;
but the remaining Bœotian towns were hostile to him. Ptolemy,
having taken Chalkis—the citizens of which he conciliated by
leaving them without any garrison—together with Oropus, Eretria,
and Karystus—entered Attica and presented himself before Athens.
So much disposition to treat with him was manifested in the city,
that Demetrius the Phalerean was obliged to gain time by pretending
to open negotiations with Antigonus, while Ptolemy withdrew from
Attica. Nearly at the same epoch, Apollonia, Epidamnus, and Leukas,
found means, assisted by an armament from Korkyra, to drive
out Kassander’s garrisons, and to escape from his dominion.<a
id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>
The affairs of Antigonus were now prospering in Greece, but they
were much thrown back by the discontent and treachery of his admiral
Telesphorus, who seized Elis and even plundered the sacred treasures
of Olympia. Ptolemy presently put him down, and restored these
treasures to the god.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862"
class="fnanchor">[862]</a></p>

<p>In the ensuing year, a convention was concluded between Antigonus,
on one side—and Kassander, Ptolemy (the Egyptian) and Lysimachus, on
the other, whereby the supreme command in Macedonia was guaranteed
to Kassander, until the maturity of Alexander son of Roxana; Thrace
being at the same time assured to Lysimachus, Egypt to Ptolemy, and
the whole of Asia to Antigonus. It was at the same time covenanted
by all, that the Hellenic cities should be free.<a id="FNanchor_863"
href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Towards the
execution of this last clause, however, nothing was actually done.
Nor does it appear that the treaty had any other effect, except
to inspire Kassander with increased jealousy about Roxana and her
child; both of whom (as has been already stated) he caused to be
secretly assassinated soon afterwards, by the governor Glaukias,
in the fortress of Amphipolis, where they had been confined.<a
id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> The
forces of Antigonus, under his general Ptolemy, still remained in
Greece. But this general presently (310 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>)
revolted from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span>
Antigonus, and placed them in co-operation with Kassander; while
Ptolemy of Egypt, accusing Antigonus of having contravened the treaty
by garrisoning various Grecian cities, renewed the war and the triple
alliance against him.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865"
class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p>Polysperchon,—who had hitherto maintained a local dominion over
various parts of Peloponnesus, with a military force distributed in
Messênê and other towns<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866"
class="fnanchor">[866]</a>—was now encouraged by Antigonus to espouse
the cause of Herakles (son of Alexander by Barsinê), and to place him
on the throne of Macedonia in opposition to Kassander. This young
prince Herakles, now seventeen years of age, was sent to Greece from
Pergamus in Asia, and his pretensions to the throne were assisted not
only by a considerable party in Macedonia itself, but also by the
Ætolians. Polysperchon invaded Macedonia, with favorable prospects
of establishing the young prince; yet he thought it advantageous to
accept treacherous propositions from Kassander, who offered to him
partnership in the sovereignty of Macedonia, with an independent
army and dominion in Peloponnesus. Polysperchon, tempted by these
offers, assassinated the young prince Herakles, and withdrew his
army towards Peloponnesus. But he found such unexpected opposition,
in his march through Bœotia, from Bœotians and Peloponnesians,
that he was forced to take up his winter quarters in Lokris<a
id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a>
(309 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). From this time forward, as far as
we can make out, he commanded in Southern Greece as subordinate ally
or partner of Kassander;<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868"
class="fnanchor">[868]</a> whose Macedonian dominion, thus confirmed,
seems to have included Akarnania and Amphilochia on the Ambrakian
Gulf, together with the town of Ambrakia itself, and a supremacy over
many of the Epirots.</p>

<p>The assassination of Herakles was speedily followed by that of
Kleopatra, sister of Alexander the Great, and daughter of Philip and
Olympias. She had been for some time at Sardis,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span> nominally at liberty, yet under watch
by the governor, who received his orders from Antigonus; she was now
preparing to quit that place, for the purpose of joining Ptolemy in
Egypt, and of becoming his wife. She had been invoked as auxiliary,
or courted in marriage, by several of the great Macedonian chiefs,
without any result. Now, however, Antigonus, afraid of the influence
which her name might throw into the scale of his rival Ptolemy,
caused her to be secretly murdered as she was preparing for her
departure; throwing the blame of the deed on some of her women, whom
he punished with death.<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869"
class="fnanchor">[869]</a> All the relatives of Alexander the Great
(except Thessalonikê wife of Kassander, daughter of Philip by a
Thessalian mistress) thus successively perished, and all by the
orders of one or other among his principal officers. The imperial
family, with the prestige of its name, thus came to an end.</p>

<p>Ptolemy of Egypt now set sail for Greece with a powerful
armament. He acquired possession of the important cities—Sikyon and
Corinth—which were handed over to him by Kratesipolis, widow of
Alexander son of Polysperchon. He then made known by proclamation
his purpose as a liberator, inviting aid from the Peloponnesian
cities themselves against the garrisons of Kassander. From some he
received encouraging answers and promises; but none of them made any
movement, or seconded him by armed demonstrations. He thought it
prudent therefore to conclude a truce with Kassander and retire from
Greece, leaving however secure garrisons in Sikyon and Corinth.<a
id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>
The Grecian cities had now become tame and passive. Feeling their
own incapacity of self-defence, and averse to auxiliary efforts,
which brought upon them enmity without any prospect of advantage—they
awaited only the turns of foreign interference and the behests of the
potentates around them.</p>

<p>The Grecian ascendency of Kassander, however, was in the
following year exposed to a graver shock than it had ever yet
encountered—by the sudden invasion of Demetrius called Poliorketes,
son of Antigonus. This young prince, sailing from Ephesus with a
formidable armament, contrived to conceal his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span> purposes so closely, that he
actually entered the harbor of Peiræus (on the 26th of the month
Thargelion—May) without expectation, or resistance from any one;
his fleet being mistaken for the fleet of the Egyptian Ptolemy. The
Phalerean Demetrius, taken unawares, and attempting too late to guard
the harbor, found himself compelled to leave it in possession of the
enemy, and to retire within the walls of Athens; while Dionysius,
the Kassandrian governor, maintained himself with his garrison
in Munychia, yet without any army competent to meet the invaders
in the field. This accomplished Phalerean, who had administered
for ten years as the viceroy and with the force of Kassander, now
felt his position and influence at Athens overthrown, and even his
personal safety endangered. He with other Athenians went as envoys
on the ensuing day to ascertain what terms would be granted. The
young prince ostentatiously proclaimed, that it was the intention
of his father Antigonus and himself to restore and guarantee to the
Athenians unqualified freedom and autonomy. Hence the Phalerean
Demetrius foresaw that his internal opponents, condemned as they
had been to compulsory silence during the last ten years, would now
proclaim themselves with irresistible violence, so that there was no
safety for him except in retreat. He accordingly asked and obtained
permission from the invader to retire to Thebes, from whence he
passed over soon after to Ptolemy in Egypt. The Athenians in the city
declared in favor of Demetrius Poliorketes; who however refused to
enter the walls until he should have besieged and captured Munychia,
as well as Megara, with their Kassandrian garrisons. In a short
time he accomplished both these objects. Indeed energy, skill, and
effective use of engines, in besieging fortified places, were among
the most conspicuous features in his character; procuring for him the
surname whereby he is known to history. He proclaimed the Megarians
free, levelling to the ground the fortifications of Munychia, as an
earnest to the Athenians that they should be relieved for the future
from all foreign garrison.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871"
class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p. 375]</span>After these
successes, Demetrius Poliorketes made his triumphant entry into
Athens. He announced to the people, in formal assembly, that they
were now again a free democracy, liberated from all dominion either
of soldiers from abroad or oligarchs at home. He also promised
them a farther boon from his father Antigonus and himself—150,000
medimni of corn for distribution, and ship-timber in quantity
sufficient for constructing 100 triremes. Both these announcements
were received with grateful exultation. The feelings of the people
were testified not merely in votes of thanks and admiration towards
the young conqueror, but in effusions of unmeasured and exorbitant
flattery. Stratokles (who has already been before us as one of
the accusers of Demosthenes in the Harpalian affair) with others
exhausted their invention in devising new varieties of compliment
and adulation. Antigonus and Demetrius were proclaimed to be not
only kings, but gods and saviors: a high priest of these saviors
was to be annually chosen, after whom each successive year was
to be named (instead of being named after the first of the nine
Archons, as had hitherto been the custom), and the dates of decrees
and contracts commemorated; the month Munychion was re-named as
Demetrion—two new tribes, to be called Antigonis and Demetrias,
were constituted in addition to the preceding ten:—the annual
senate was appointed to consist of 600 members instead of 500;
the portraits and exploits of Antigonus and Demetrius were to be
woven, along with those of Zeus and Athênê, into the splendid and
voluminous robe periodically carried in procession, as an offering
at the Panathenaic festival; the spot of ground where Demetrius had
alighted from his chariot, was consecrated with an altar erected
in honor of Demetrius Katæbates or the Descender. Several other
similar votes were passed, recognizing, and worshipping as gods,
the saviors Antigonus and Demetrius. Nay, we are told that temples
or altars were voted to Phila-Aphroditê, in honor of Phila wife of
Demetrius; and a like compliment was paid to his two mistresses,
Leæna and Lamia. Altars are said to have been also dedicated to
Adeimantus and others, his convivial companions or flatterers.<a
id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> At
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span> same time the
numerous statues which had been erected in honor of the Phalerean
Demetrius during his decennial government, were overthrown, and some
of them even turned to ignoble purposes, in order to cast greater
scorn upon the past ruler.<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873"
class="fnanchor">[873]</a> The demonstrations of servile flattery at
Athens, towards Demetrius Poliorketes, were in fact so extravagantly
overdone, that he himself is said to have been disgusted with them,
and to have expressed contempt for these degenerate Athenians
of his own time.<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874"
class="fnanchor">[874]</a></p>

<p>In reviewing such degrading proceedings, we must recollect that
thirty-one years had now elapsed since the battle of Chæroneia,
and that during all this time the Athenians had been under the
practical ascendancy, and constantly augmenting pressure, of foreign
potentates. The sentiment of this dependence on Macedonia had been
continually strengthened by all the subsequent events—by the capture
and destruction of Thebes, and the subsequent overwhelming conquests
of Alexander—by the deplorable conclusion of the Lamian war, the
slaughter of the free-spoken orators, the death of the energetic
military leaders, and the deportation of Athenian citizens—lastly,
by the continued presence of a Macedonian garrison in Peiræus or
Munychia. By Phokion, Demetrius Phalereus, and the other leading
statesmen of this long period, submission to Macedonia had been
inculcated as a virtue, while the recollection of the dignity and
grandeur of old autonomous Athens had been effaced or denounced
as a mischievous dream. The fifteen years between the close of
the Lamian war and the arrival of Demetrius Poliorketes (322-307
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), had witnessed no free play, nor public
discussion and expression, of conflicting opinions; the short period
during which Phokion was condemned must be excepted, but that lasted
only long enough to give room for the outburst of a preconceived but
suppressed antipathy.</p>

<p>During this thirty years, of which the last half had been an
aggravation of the first, a new generation of Athenians had grown
up, accustomed to an altered phase of political existence.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span> How few of those who
received Demetrius Poliorketes, had taken part in the battle of
Chæroneia, or listened to the stirring exhortations of Demosthenes
in the war which preceded that disaster!<a id="FNanchor_875"
href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> Of the citizens
who yet retained courage and patriotism to struggle again for
their freedom after the death of Alexander, how many must have
perished with Leosthenes in the Lamian war! The Athenians of 307
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> had come to conceive their own city, and
Hellas generally, as dependent first on Kassander, next on the
possible intervention of his equally overweening rivals, Ptolemy,
Antigonus, Lysimachus, etc. If they shook off the yoke of one
potentate, it could only be by the protectorate of another. The
sentiment of political self-reliance and autonomy had fled; the
conception of a citizen military force, furnished by confederate
and co-operating cities, had been superseded by the spectacle of
vast standing armies, organized by the heirs of Alexander and of his
traditions.</p>

<p>Two centuries before (510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), when the
Lacedæmonians expelled the despot Hippias and his mercenaries
from Athens, there sprang up at once among the Athenian people
a forward and devoted patriotism, which made them willing to
brave, and competent to avert, all dangers in defence of their
newly-acquired liberty.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876"
class="fnanchor">[876]</a> At that time, the enemies by whom they
were threatened were Lacedæmonians, Thebans, Æginetans, Chalkidians,
and the like (for the Persian force did not present itself until
after some interval, and attacked not Athens alone, but Greece
collectively). These hostile forces, though superior in number and
apparent value to those of Athens, were yet not so disproportionate
as to engender hopelessness and despair. Very different were the
facts in 307 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, when Demetrius Poliorketes
removed the Kassandrian mercenaries with their fortress Munychia,
and proclaimed Athens free. To maintain that freedom by their own
strength—in opposition to the evident superiority of organized
force residing in the potentates around, one<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_378">[p. 378]</span> or more of whom had nearly all Greece
under military occupation,—was an enterprise too hopeless to have
been attempted even by men such as the combatants of Marathon or
the contemporaries of Perikles. “Who would be free, themselves must
strike the blow!” but the Athenians had not force enough to strike
it; and the liberty proclaimed by Demetrius Poliorketes was a boon
dependent upon him for its extent and even for its continuance. The
Athenian assembly of that day was held under his army as masters of
Attica, as it had been held a few months before under the controlling
force of the Phalerean Demetrius together with the Kassandrian
governor of Munychia; and the most fulsome votes of adulation
proposed in honor of Demetrius Poliorketes by his partisans, though
perhaps disapproved by many, would hardly find a single pronounced
opponent.</p>

<p>One man, however, there was, who ventured to oppose several
of the votes—the nephew of Demosthenes—Demochares; who deserves
to be commemorated as the last known spokesman of free Athenian
citizenship. We know only that such were his general politics,
and that his opposition to the obsequious rhetor Stratokles
ended in banishment, four years afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_877"
href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> He appears to have
discharged the functions of general during this period—to have been
active in strengthening the fortifications and military equipment
of the city—and to have been employed in occasional missions.<a
id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

<p>The altered politics of Athens were manifested by impeachment
against Demetrius Phalereus and other leading partisans of the
late Kassandrian government. He and many others had already gone
into voluntary exile; when their trials came on, they were not
forthcoming, and all were condemned to death. But all those who
remained, and presented themselves for trial, were acquitted;<a
id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
so little was there of reactionary violence on this occasion.
Stratokles also proposed a decree, commemorating the orator
Lykurgus (who had been dead about seventeen years) by a statue, an
honorary inscription, and a grant of main<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span>tenance in the Prytaneum to his eldest
surviving descendant.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880"
class="fnanchor">[880]</a> Among those who accompanied the Phalerean
Demetrius into exile was the rhetor or logographer Deinarchus.</p>

<p>The friendship of this obnoxious Phalerean, and of Kassander also,
towards the philosopher Theophrastus, seems to have been one main
cause which occasioned the enactment of a restrictive law against
the liberty of philosophizing. It was decreed, on the proposition of
a citizen named Sophokles, that no philosopher should be allowed to
open a school or teach, except under special sanction obtained from a
vote of the Senate and people. Such was the disgust and apprehension
occasioned by the new restriction, that all the philosophers with
one accord left Athens. This spirited protest, against authoritative
restriction on the liberty of philosophy and teaching, found
responsive sympathy among the Athenians. The celebrity of the schools
and professors was in fact the only characteristic mark of dignity
still remaining to them—when their power had become extinct, and
when even their independence and free constitution had degene<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span>rated into a mere
name. It was moreover the great temptation for young men, coming
from all parts of Greece, to visit Athens. Accordingly, a year had
hardly passed, when Philon, impeaching Sophokles the author of the
law, under the Graphê Paranomôn, prevailed on the Dikastery to
find him guilty, and condemn him to a fine of five talents. The
restrictive law being thus repealed, the philosophers returned.<a
id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a>
It is remarkable that Demochares stood forward as one of its
advocates; defending Sophokles against the accuser Philon. From
scanty notices remaining of the speech of Demochares, we gather
that, while censuring the opinions no less than the characters of
Plato and Aristotle, he denounced yet more bitterly their pupils,
as being for the most part ambitious, violent, and treacherous men.
He cited by name several among them, who had subverted the freedom
of their respective cities, and committed gross outrages against
their fellow-citizens.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882"
class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>Athenian envoys were despatched to Antigonus in Asia, to testify
the gratitude of the people, and communicate the recent complimentary
votes. Antigonus not only received them graciously, but sent to
Athens, according to the promise made by his son, a large present
of 150,000 medimni of wheat, with timber sufficient for 100 ships.
He at the same time directed Demetrius to convene at Athens a synod
of deputies from the allied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p.
381]</span> Grecian cities, where resolutions might be taken for the
common interests of Greece.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883"
class="fnanchor">[883]</a> It was his interest at this moment to
raise up a temporary self-sustaining authority in Greece, for the
purpose of upholding the alliance with himself, during the absence
of Demetrius; whom he was compelled to summon into Asia with his
army—requiring his services for the war against Ptolemy in Syria and
Cyprus.</p>

<p>The following three years were spent by Demetrius—1. In
victorious operations near Cyprus, defeating Ptolemy and making
himself master of that island; after which Antigonus and Demetrius
assumed the title of kings, and the example was followed by Ptolemy,
in Egypt—by Lysimachus, in Thrace—and by Seleukus in Babylonia,
Mesopotamia, and Syria<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884"
class="fnanchor">[884]</a>—thus abolishing even the titular
remembrance of Alexander’s family. 2. In an unsuccessful invasion
of Egypt by land and sea, repulsed with great loss. 3. In the
siege of Rhodes. The brave and intelligent citizens of this island
resisted for more than a year the most strenuous attacks and the
most formidable siege-equipments of Demetrius Poliorketes. All their
efforts however would have been vain had they not been assisted by
large reinforcements and supplies from Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and
Kassander. Such are the conditions under which alone even the most
resolute and intelligent Greeks can now retain their circumscribed
sphere of autonomy. The siege was at length terminated by a
compromise; the Rhodians submitted to enrol themselves as allies
of Demetrius, yet under proviso not to act against Ptolemy.<a
id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>
Towards the latter they carried their grateful devotion so far,
as to erect a temple to him, called the Ptolemæum, and to worship
him (under the sanction of the oracle of Ammon) as a god.<a
id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a>
Amidst the rocks and shoals through which Grecian cities were now
condemned to steer, menaced on every side by kings more powerful than
themselves, and afterwards by the giant-republic of Rome—the Rhodians
conducted their political affairs with greater prudence and dignity
than any other Grecian city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span>Shortly after
the departure of Demetrius from Greece to Cyprus, Kassander and
Polysperchon renewed the war in Peloponnesus and its neighborhood.<a
id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>
We make out no particulars respecting this war. The Ætolians were
in hostility with Athens, and committed annoying depredations.<a
id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>
The fleet of Athens, repaired or increased by the timber received
from Antigonus, was made to furnish thirty quadriremes to assist
Demetrius in Cyprus, and was employed in certain operations near the
island of Amorgos, wherein it suffered defeat.<a id="FNanchor_889"
href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> But we can discover
little respecting the course of the war, except that Kassander
gained ground upon the Athenians, and that about the beginning of
303 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, he was blockading or threatening
to blockade, Athens. The Athenians invoked the aid of Demetrius
Poliorketes, who, having recently concluded an accommodation with
the Rhodians, came again across from Asia, with a powerful fleet and
army, to Aulis in Bœotia.<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890"
class="fnanchor">[890]</a> He was received at Athens with
demonstrations of honor equal or superior to those which had marked
his previous visit. He seems to have passed a year and a half,
partly at Athens, partly in military operations carried successfully
over many parts of Greece. He compelled the Bœotians to evacuate
the Eubœan city of Chalkis, and to relinquish their alliance with
Kassander. He drove that prince out of Attica—expelled his garrisons
from the two frontier fortresses of Attica,—Phylê and Panaktum—and
pursued him as far as Thermopylæ. He captured, or obtained by bribing
the garrisons, the important towns of Corinth, Argos, and Sikyon;
mastering also Ægium, Bura, all the Arcadian towns (except Man<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span>tineia), and various
other towns in Peloponnesus.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891"
class="fnanchor">[891]</a> He celebrated, as president, the great
festival of the Heræa at Argos; on which occasion he married
Deidameia, sister of Pyrrhus, the young king of Epirus. He prevailed
on the Sikyonians to transfer to a short distance the site of
their city, conferring upon the new city the name of Demetrias.<a
id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>
At a Grecian synod, convened in Corinth under his own letters of
invitation, he received by acclamation the appointment of leader
or Emperor of the Greeks, as it had been conferred on Philip and
Alexander. He even extended his attacks as far as Leukas and Korkyra.
The greater part of Greece seems to have been either occupied by his
garrisons, or enlisted among his subordinates.</p>

<p>So much was Kassander intimidated by these successes, that
he sent envoys to Asia, soliciting peace from Antigonus; who,
however, elate and full of arrogance, refused to listen to any
terms short of surrender at discretion. Kassander, thus driven
to despair, renewed his applications to Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and
Seleukus. All these princes felt equally menaced by the power
and dispositions of Antigonus—and all resolved upon an energetic
combination to put him down.<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893"
class="fnanchor">[893]</a></p>

<p>After uninterrupted prosperity in Greece, throughout the summer
of 302 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Demetrius returned from Leukas
to Athens, about the month of September, near the time of the
Eleusinian mysteries.<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894"
class="fnanchor">[894]</a> He was welcomed by festive processions,
hymns, pæans, choric dances, and bacchanalian odes of joyous
congratulation. One of these hymns is preserved, sung by a chorus
of Ithyphalli—masked revellers, with their heads and arms encircled
by wreaths,—clothed in white tunics, and in feminine garments
reaching almost to the feet.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895"
class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span>This song is
curious, as indicating the hopes and fears prevalent among Athenians
of that day, and as affording a measure of their self-appreciation.
It is moreover among the latest Grecian documents that we possess,
bearing on actual and present reality. The poet, addressing Demetrius
as a god, boasts that two of the greatest and best-beloved of all
divine beings are visiting Attica at the same moment—Demeter (coming
for the season of her mysteries), and Demetrius, son of Poseidon
and Aphroditê. “To thee we pray (the hymn proceeds); for other gods
are either afar off—or have no ears—or do not exist—or care nothing
about us; but <i>thee</i> we see before us, not in wood or marble, but in
real presence. First of all things, establish peace; for thou hast
the power—and chastise that Sphinx who domineers, not merely over
Thebes, but over all Greece—the Ætolian, who, (like the old Sphinx)
rushes from his station on the rock to snatch and carry away our
persons, and against whom we cannot fight. At all times, the Ætolians
robbed their neighbors; but now, they rob far as well as near.<a
id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a>”</p>

<p>Effusions such as these, while displaying unmeasured
idolatry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span> and
subservience towards Demetrius, are yet more remarkable, as betraying
a loss of force, a senility, and a consciousness of defenceless
and degraded position, such as we are astonished to find publicly
proclaimed at Athens. It is not only against the foreign potentates
that the Athenians avow themselves incapable of self-defence,
but even against the incursions of the Ætolians.—Greeks like
themselves, though warlike, rude, and restless.<a id="FNanchor_897"
href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> When such were
the feelings of a people, once the most daring, confident, and
organizing—and still the most intelligent—in Greece, we may see that
the history of the Greeks as a separate nation or race is reaching
its close—and that from henceforward they must become merged in one
or other of the stronger currents that surround them.</p>

<p>After his past successes, Demetrius passed some months in
enjoyment and luxury at Athens. He was lodged in the Parthenon, being
considered as the guest of the goddess Athênê. But his dissolute
habits provoked the louder comments, from being indulged in such a
domicile; while the violences which he offered to beautiful youths
of good family led to various scenes truly tragical. The subservient
manifestations of the Athenians towards him, however, continued
unabated. It is even affirmed, that, in order to compensate for
something which he had taken amiss, they passed a formal decree,
on the proposition of Stratokles, declaring that every thing
which Demetrius might command was holy in regard to the gods, and
just in regard to men.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898"
class="fnanchor">[898]</a> The banishment of Demochares is said to
have been brought on by his sarcastic comments upon this decree.<a
id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>
In the month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span>
Munychion (April) Demetrius mustered his forces and his Grecian
allies for a march into Thessaly against Kassander; but before
his departure, he was anxious to be initiated in the Eleusinian
mysteries. It was however not the regular time for this ceremony;
the Lesser Mysteries being celebrated in February, the Greater in
September. The Athenians overruled the difficulty by passing a
special vote, enabling him to be initiated at once, and to receive
in immediate succession, the preparatory and the final initiation,
between which ceremonies a year of interval was habitually required.
Accordingly, he placed himself disarmed in the hands of the priests,
and received both first and second initiation in the month of April,
immediately before his departure from Athens.<a id="FNanchor_900"
href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p>Demetrius conducted into Thessaly an army of 56,000 men; of whom
25,000 were Grecian allies—so extensive was his sway at this moment
over the Grecian cities.<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901"
class="fnanchor">[901]</a> But after two or three months of
hostilities, partially successful, against Kassander, he was summoned
into Asia by Antigonus to assist in meet<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span>ing the formidable army of the
allies—Ptolemy, Seleukus, Lysimachus, and Kassander. Before retiring
from Greece, Demetrius concluded a truce with Kassander, whereby it
was stipulated that the Grecian cities, both in Europe and Asia,
should be permanently autonomous and free from garrison or control.
This stipulation served only as an honorable pretext for leaving
Greece; Demetrius had little expectation that it would be observed.<a
id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a>
In the ensuing spring was fought the decisive battle of Ipsus in
Phrygia (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 300), by Antigonus and Demetrius,
against Ptolemy, Seleukus, and Lysimachus; with a large army and
many elephants on both sides. Antigonus was completely defeated and
slain, at the age of more than eighty years. His Asiatic dominion
was broken up, chiefly to the profit of Seleukus, whose dynasty
became from henceforward ascendent, from the coast of Syria eastward
to the Caspian Gates and Parthia; sometimes, though imperfectly,
farther eastward, nearly to the Indus.<a id="FNanchor_903"
href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>The effects of the battle of Ipsus were speedily felt in Greece.
The Athenians passed a decree proclaiming themselves neutral, and
excluding both the belligerent parties from Attica. Demetrius,
retiring with the remnant of his defeated army, and embarking at
Ephesus to sail to Athens, was met on the voyage by Athenian envoys,
who respectfully acquainted him that he would not be admitted.
At the same time, his wife Deidameia, whom<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_388">[p. 388]</span> he had left at Athens, was sent away by
the Athenians under an honorable escort to Megara, while some ships
of war which he had left in the Peiræus were also restored to him.
Demetrius, indignant at this unexpected defection of a city which had
recently heaped upon him such fulsome adulation, was still farther
mortified by the loss of most of his other possessions in Greece.<a
id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a>
His garrisons were for the most part expelled, and the cities passed
into Kassandrian keeping or dominion. His fortunes were indeed
partially restored by concluding a peace with Seleukus, who married
his daughter. This alliance withdrew Demetrius to Syria, while
Greece appears to have fallen more and more under the Kassandrian
parties. It was one of these partisans, Lachares, who, seconded
by Kassander’s soldiers, acquired a despotism at Athens such as
had been possessed by the Phalerean Demetrius, but employed in a
manner far more cruel and oppressive. Various exiles driven out by
his tyranny invited Demetrius Poliorketes, who passed over again
from Asia into Greece, recovered portions of Peloponnesus, and laid
siege to Athens. He blocked up the city by sea and land, so that the
pressure of famine presently became intolerable. Lachares having
made his escape, the people opened their gates to Demetrius, not
without great fear of the treatment awaiting them. But he behaved
with forbearance, and even with generosity. He spared them all,
supplied them with a large donation of corn, and contented himself
with taking military occupation of the city, naming his own friends
as magistrates. He put garrisons, however, not only into Peiræus and
Munychia, but also into the hill called Museum, a part of the walled
circle of Athens itself<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905"
class="fnanchor">[905]</a> (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 298).</p>

<p>While Demetrius was thus strengthening himself in Greece, he lost
all his footing both in Cyprus, Syria, and Kilikia, which<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[p. 389]</span> passed into the hands
of Ptolemy and Seleukus. New prospects however were opened to him
in Macedonia by the death of Kassander (his brother-in-law, brother
of his wife Phila) and the family feuds supervening thereupon.
Philippus, eldest son of Kassander, succeeded his father, but died of
sickness after something more than a year. Between the two remaining
sons, Antipater and Alexander, a sanguinary hostility broke out.
Antipater slew his mother Thessalonikê, and threatened the life of
his brother, who in his turn invited aid both from Demetrius, and
from the Epirotic king Pyrrhus. Pyrrhus being ready first, marched
into Macedonia, and expelled Antipater; receiving as his recompense
the territory called Tymphæa (between Epirus and Macedonia), together
with Akarnania, Amphilochia, and the town of Ambrakia, which became
henceforward his chief city and residence.<a id="FNanchor_906"
href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> Antipater sought
shelter in Thrace with his father-in-law Lysimachus; by whose order,
however, he was presently slain. Demetrius, occupied with other
matters, was more tardy in obeying the summons; but, on entering
into Macedonia, he found himself strong enough to dispossess and
kill Alexander (who had indeed invited him, but is said to have
laid a train for assassinating him), and seized the Macedonian
crown; not without the assent of a considerable party, to whom the
name and the deeds of Kassander and his sons were alike odious.<a
id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>Demetrius became thus master of Macedonia, together with the
greater part of Greece, including Athens, Megara, and much of
Peloponnesus. He undertook an expedition into Bœotia, for the purpose
of conquering Thebes; in which attempt he succeeded, not without a
double siege of that city, which made an obstinate resistance. He
left as viceroy in Bœotia the historian, Hieronymus of Kardia,<a
id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>
once the attached friend and fellow-citizen of Eumenes. But Greece
as a whole was managed by Antigonus (afterwards called Antigonus
Gonatas) son of Demetrius, who maintained his supremacy unshaken
during all his father’s lifetime; even though Demetrius was deprived
of Mace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[p. 390]</span>donia by
the temporary combination of Lysimachus with Pyrrhus, and afterwards
remained (until his death in 283 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>)
a captive in the hands of Seleukus. After a brief possession
of the crown of Macedonia successively by Seleukus, Ptolemy,
Keraunus, Meleager, Antipater, and Sosthenes—Antigonus Gonatas
regained it in 277 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> His descendants the
Antigonid kings maintained it until the battle of Pydna in 168
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; when Perseus, the last of them, was
overthrown, and his kingdom incorporated with the Roman conquests.<a
id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p>Of Greece during this period we can give no account, except
that the greater number of its cities were in dependence upon
Demetrius and his son Antigonus; either under occupation by
Macedonian garrisons, or ruled by local despots who leaned on
foreign mercenaries and Macedonian support. The spirit of the
Greeks was broken, and their habits of combined sentiment and
action had disappeared. The invasion of the Gauls indeed awakened
them into a temporary union for the defence of Thermopylæ in
279 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> So intolerable was the cruelty
and spoliation of those barbarian invaders, that the cities as
well as Antigonus were driven by fear to the efforts necessary
for repelling them.<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910"
class="fnanchor">[910]</a> A gallant army of Hellenic confederates
was mustered. In the mountains of Ætolia and in the neighborhood of
Delphi, most of the Gallic horde with their king Brennus perished.
But this burst of spirit did not interrupt the continuance of the
Macedonian dominion in Greece, which Antigonus Gonatas continued
to hold throughout most of a long reign. He greatly extended the
system begun by his predecessors, of isolating each Grecian city
from alliances with other cities in its neighborhood—planting in
most of them local despots—and compressing the most important
by means of garrisons.<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911"
class="fnanchor">[911]</a> Among all Greeks, the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span> Spartans and the
Ætolians stood most free from foreign occupation, and were the
least crippled in their power of self-action. The Achæan league too
developed itself afterwards as a renovated sprout from the ruined
tree of Grecian liberty,<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912"
class="fnanchor">[912]</a> though never attaining to anything better
than a feeble and puny life, nor capable of sustaining itself
without foreign aid.<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913"
class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>

<p>With this after-growth, or half-revival, I shall not meddle.
It forms the Greece of Polybius, which that author treats, in my
opinion justly, as having no history of its own,<a id="FNanchor_914"
href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> but as an
appendage attached to some foreign centre and principal among its
neighbors—Macedonia, Egypt, Syria, Rome. Each of these neighbors
acted upon the destinies of Greece more powerfully than the Greeks
themselves. The Greeks to whom these volumes have been devoted—those
of Homer, Archilochus, Solon, Æschylus, Herodotus, Thucydides,
Xenophon, and Demosthenes—present as their most marked characteristic
a loose aggregation of autonomous tribes or communities, acting
and reacting freely among themselves, with little or no pressure
from foreigners. The main interest of the narrative has consisted
in the spontaneous grouping of the different Hellenic fractions—in
the self-prompted cooperations and conflicts—the abortive attempts
to bring about something like an effective federal organization,
or to maintain two permanent rival confederacies—the energetic
ambition, and heroic endurance, of men to whom Hellas was the entire
political world. The freedom of Hellas, the life and soul of this
history from its commencement, disappeared completely during the
first years of Alexander’s reign. After following to their tombs the
generation of Greeks contemporary with him, men like Demosthenes and
Phokion, born in a state of freedom—I have pursued the history into
that gulf of Grecian nullity which marks the succeeding century;
exhibiting sad evidence of the degrading servility, and suppliant
king-worship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[p. 392]</span>
into which the countrymen of Aristeides and Perikles had been driven,
by their own conscious weakness under overwhelming pressure from
without.</p>

<p>I cannot better complete that picture than by showing what the
leading democratical citizen became, under the altered atmosphere
which now bedimmed his city. Demochares, the nephew of Demosthenes,
has been mentioned as one of the few distinguished Athenians
in this last generation. He was more than once chosen to the
highest public offices;<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915"
class="fnanchor">[915]</a> he was conspicuous for his free speech,
both as an orator and as an historian, in the face of powerful
enemies; he remained throughout a long life faithfully attached to
the democratical constitution, and was banished for a time by its
opponents. In the year 280 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, he prevailed
on the Athenians to erect a public monument, with a commemorative
inscription, to his uncle Demosthenes. Seven or eight years
afterwards, Demochares himself died, aged nearly eighty. His son
Laches proposed and obtained a public decree, that a statue should
be erected, with an annexed inscription, to his honor. We read in
the decree a recital of the distinguished public services, whereby
Demochares merited this compliment from his countrymen. All that
the proposer of the decree, his son and fellow-citizen, can find to
recite, as ennobling the last half of the father’s public life (since
his return from exile), is as follows:—1. He contracted the public
expenses, and introduced a more frugal management. 2. He undertook an
embassy to King Lysimachus, from whom he obtained two presents for
the people, one of thirty talents, the other of one hundred talents.
3. He proposed the vote for sending envoys to King Ptolemy in Egypt,
from whom fifty talents were obtained for the people. 4. He went as
envoy to Antipater, received from him twenty talents, and delivered
them to the people at the Eleusinian festival.<a id="FNanchor_916"
href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span>When such
begging missions are the deeds, for which Athens both employed and
recompensed her most eminent citizens, an historian accustomed to the
Grecian world as described by Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon,
feels that the life has departed from his subject, and with sadness
and humiliation brings his narrative to a close.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XCVII.<br />
    SICILIAN AND ITALIAN GREEKS. — AGATHOKLES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">It</span> has been convenient,
throughout all this work, to keep the history of the Italian and
Sicilian Greeks distinct from that of the Central and Asiatic.
We parted last from the Sicilian Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_917"
href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> at the death of their
champion the Corinthian Timoleon (337 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
by whose energetic exploits, and generous political policy, they
had been almost regenerated—rescued from foreign enemies, protected
against intestine discord, and invigorated by a large reinforcement
of new colonists. For the twenty years next succeeding the death
of Timoleon, the history of Syracuse and Sicily is an absolute
blank; which is deeply to be regretted, since the position of these
cities included so much novelty—so many subjects for debate, for
peremptory settlement, or for amicable compromise—that the annals
of their proceedings must have been peculiarly interesting. Twenty
years after the death of Timoleon, we find the government of
Syracuse described as an oligarchy; implying that the constitution
established by Timoleon must have been changed either by violence
or by consent. The oligarchy is stated as consisting of 600 chief
men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span> among whom
Sosistratus and Herakleides appear as leaders.<a id="FNanchor_918"
href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> We hear generally
that the Syracusans had been engaged in wars, and that Sosistratus
either first originated, or first firmly established, his oligarchy,
after an expedition undertaken to the coast of Italy, to assist the
citizens of Kroton against their interior neighbors and assailants
the Bruttians.</p>

<p>Not merely Kroton, but other Grecian cities also on the coast of
Italy, appear to have been exposed to causes of danger and decline,
similar to those which were operating upon so many other portions
of the Hellenic world. Their non-Hellenic neighbors in the interior
were growing too powerful and too aggressive to leave them in peace
or security. The Messapians, the Lucanians, the Bruttians, and other
native Italian tribes, were acquiring that increased strength which
became ultimately all concentrated under the mighty republic of Rome.
I have in my preceding volume recounted the acts of the two Syracusan
despots, the elder and younger Dionysius, on this Italian coast.<a
id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a>
Though the elder gained some advantage over the Lucanians, yet the
interference of both contributed only to enfeeble and humiliate the
Italiot Greeks. Not long before the battle of Chæroneia (340-338
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the Tarentines found themselves so
hard pressed by the Messapians, that they sent to Sparta, their
mother-city, to entreat assistance. The Spartan king Archidamus
son of Agesilaus, perhaps ashamed of the nullity of his country
since the close of the Sacred War, complied with their prayer, and
sailed at the head of a mercenary force to Italy. How long his
operations there lasted, we do not know; but they ended by his being
defeated and killed, near the time of the battle of Chæroneia<a
id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a>
(338 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>).</p>

<p>About six years after this event, the Tarentines, being still
pressed by the same formidable neighbors, invoked the aid of the
Epirotic Alexander, king of the Molossians, and brother of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span> Olympias. These Epirots
now, during the general decline of Grecian force, rise into an
importance which they had never before enjoyed<a id="FNanchor_921"
href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a>. Philip of Macedon,
having married Olympias, not only secured his brother-in-law on
the Molossian throne, but strengthened his authority over subjects
not habitually obedient. It was through Macedonian interference
that the Molossian Alexander first obtained (though subject to
Macedonian ascendency) the important city of Ambrakia; which thus
passed out of a free Hellenic community into the capital and seaport
of the Epirotic kings. Alexander farther cemented his union with
Macedonia by marrying his own niece Kleopatra, daughter of Philip
and Olympias. In fact, during the lives of Philip and Alexander
the Great, the Epirotic kingdom appears a sort of adjunct to the
Macedonian; governed by Olympias either jointly with her brother the
Molossian Alexander—or as regent after his death.<a id="FNanchor_922"
href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p. 396]</span>It was
about the year after the battle of Issus that the Molossian
Alexander undertook his expedition into Italy;<a id="FNanchor_923"
href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> doubtless instigated
in part by emulation of the Asiatic glories of his nephew and
namesake. Though he found enemies more formidable than the Persians
at Issus, yet his success was at first considerable. He gained
victories over the Messapians, the Lucanians, and the Samnites; he
conquered the Lucanian town of Consentia, and the Bruttian town
of Tereina; he established an alliance with the Pœdiculi, and
exchanged friendly messages with the Romans. As far as we can make
out from scanty data, he seems to have calculated on establishing
a comprehensive dominion in the south of Italy, over all its
population—over Greek cities, Lucanians, and Bruttians. He demanded
and obtained three hundred of the chief Lucanian and Messapian
families, whom he sent over as hostages to Epirus. Several exiles
of these nations joined him as partisans. He farther endeavored
to transfer the congress of the Greco-Italian cities, which had
been usually held at the Tarentine colony of Herakleia, to Thurii;
intending probably to procure for himself a compliant synod like that
serving the purpose of his Macedonian nephew at Corinth. But the tide
of his fortune at length turned. The Tarentines became disgusted and
alarmed; his Lucanian partisans proved faithless; the stormy weather
in the Calabrian Apennines broke up the communication between his
different detachments, and exposed them to be cut off in detail. He
himself perished, by the hands of a Lucanian exile, in crossing the
river Acheron, and near the town of Pandosia. This was held to be a
memorable attestation of the prophetic veracity of the oracle; since
he had received advice from Dodona to beware of Pandosia and Acheron;
two names which he well knew, and therefore avoided, in Epirus—but
which he had not before known to exist in Italy.<a id="FNanchor_924"
href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p>The Greco-Italian cities had thus dwindled down into a prize to
be contended for between the Epirotic kings and the native<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[p. 397]</span> Italian powers—as they
again became, still more conspicuously, fifty years afterwards,
during the war between Pyrrhus and the Romans. They were now left
to seek foreign aid, where they could obtain it, and to become the
prey of adventurers. It is in this capacity that we hear of them
as receiving assistance from Syracuse, and that the formidable
name of Agathokles first comes before us—seemingly about 320
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925"
class="fnanchor">[925]</a> The Syracusan force, sent to Italy to
assist the Krotoniates against their enemies the Bruttians, was
commanded by a general named Antander, whose brother Agathokles
served with him in a subordinate command.</p>

<p>To pass over the birth and childhood of Agathokles—respecting
which, romantic anecdotes are told, as about most eminent men,—it
appears that his father, a Rhegine exile named Karkinus, came
from Therma (in the Carthaginian portion of Sicily) to settle
at Syracuse, at the time when Timoleon invited and received new
Grecian settlers to the citizenship of the latter city. Karkinus
was in comparative poverty, following the trade of a potter; which
his son Agathokles learnt also, being about eighteen years of age
when domiciliated with his father at Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_926"
href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> Though starting
from this humble beginning, and even notorious for the profligacy
and rapacity of his youthful habits, Agathokles soon attained
a conspicuous position, partly from his own superior personal
qualities, partly from the favor of a wealthy Syracusan named Damas.
The young potter was handsome, tall, and of gigantic strength; he
performed with distinction the military service required from him as
a citizen, wearing a panoply so heavy, that no other soldier could
fight with it; he was moreover ready, audacious, and emphatic in
public harangue. Damas became much attached to him, and not only
supplied him profusely with money, but also, when placed in command
of a Syracusan army against the Agrigentines, nominated him one
of the subordinate officers. In this capacity Agathokles acquired
great reputation, for courage in battle, ability in command, and
fluency of speech. Presently Damas died of sickness, leaving a widow
without children. Agathokles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[p.
398]</span> married the widow, and thus raised himself to a
high fortune and position in Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_927"
href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p>Of the oligarchy which now prevailed at Syracuse, we have no
particulars, nor do we know how it had come to be substituted
for the more popular forms established by Timoleon. We hear only
generally that the oligarchical leaders, Sosistratus and Herakleides,
were unprincipled and sanguinary men.<a id="FNanchor_928"
href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> By this government
an expedition was despatched from Syracuse to the Italian coast, to
assist the inhabitants of Kroton against their aggressive neighbors
the Bruttians. Antander, brother of Agathokles, was one of the
generals commanding this armament, and Agathokles himself served in
it as a subordinate officer. We neither know the date, the duration,
nor the issue, of this expedition.</p>

<p>But it afforded a fresh opportunity to Agathokles to display his
adventurous bravery and military genius, which procured for him
high encomium. He was supposed by some, on his return to Syracuse,
to be entitled to the first prize for valor; but Sosistratus and
the other oligarchical leaders withheld it from him and preferred
another. So deeply was Agathokles incensed by this refusal, that he
publicly inveighed against them among the people, as men aspiring to
despotism. His opposition being unsuccessful, and drawing upon him
the enmity of the government, he retired to the coast of Italy.</p>

<p>Here he levied a military band of Grecian exiles and Campanian
mercenaries, which he maintained by various enterprises for or
against the Grecian cities. He attacked Kroton, but was repulsed
with loss; he took service with the Tarentines, fought for some time
against their enemies, but at length became suspected and dismissed;
he then joined himself with the inhabitants of Rhegium, assisting
in the defence of the town against a Syracusan aggression. He even
made two attempts to obtain admission by force into Syracuse, and
to seize the government.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929"
class="fnanchor">[929]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[p.
399]</span> Though repulsed in both of them, he nevertheless
contrived to maintain a footing in Sicily, was appointed general
at the town of Morgantium, and captured Leontini, within a short
distance north of Syracuse. Some time afterwards, a revolution
took place at Syracuse, whereby Sosistratus and the oligarchy were
dispossessed and exiled with many of their partisans.</p>

<p>Under the new government, Agathokles obtained his recall, and
soon gained increased ascendency. The dispossessed exiles contrived
to raise forces, and to carry on a formidable war against Syracuse
from without; they even obtained assistance from the Carthaginians,
so as to establish themselves at Gela, on the southern confines of
the Syracusan territory. In the military operations thus rendered
necessary, Agathokles took a forward part, distinguishing himself
among the ablest and most enterprising officers. He tried, with 1000
soldiers, to surprise Gela by night; but finding the enemy on their
guard, he was repulsed with loss and severely wounded; yet by an able
manœuvre he brought off all his remaining detachment. Though thus
energetic against the public enemy, however, he at the same time
inspired both hatred and alarm for his dangerous designs, to the
Syracusans within. The Corinthian Akestorides, who had been named
general of the city—probably from recollection of the distinguished
services formerly rendered by the Corinthian Timoleon—becoming
persuaded that the presence of Agathokles was full of peril to the
city, ordered him to depart, and provided men to assassinate him on
the road during the night. But Agathokles, suspecting their design,
disguised himself in the garb of a beggar, appointing another man to
travel in the manner which would be naturally expected from himself.
This substitute was slain in the dark by the assassins, while
Agathokles escaped by favor of his disguise. He and his partisans
appear to have found shelter with the Carthaginians in Sicily.<a
id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span>Not long
afterwards, another change took place in the government of Syracuse,
whereby the oligarchical exiles were recalled, and peace made
with the Carthaginians. It appears that a senate of 600 was again
installed as the chief political body; probably not the same men as
before, and with some democratical modifications. At the same time,
negotiations were opened, through the mediation of the Carthaginian
commander Hamilkar, between the Syracusans and Agathokles. The
mischiefs of intestine conflict, amidst the numerous discordant
parties in the city, pressed hard upon every one, and hopes were
entertained that all might be brought to agree in terminating
them. Agathokles affected to enter cordially into these projects
of amnesty and reconciliation. The Carthaginian general Hamilkar,
who had so recently aided Sosistratus and the Syracusan oligarchy,
now did his best to promote the recall of Agathokles, and even made
himself responsible for the good and pacific behavior of that exile.
Agathokles, and the other exiles along with him were accordingly
restored. A public assembly was convened in the temple of Demeter,
in the presence of Hamilkar; where Agathokles swore by the most
awful oaths, with his hands touching the altar and statue of the
goddess, that he would behave as a good citizen of Syracuse, uphold
faithfully the existing government, and carry out the engagements
of the Carthaginian mediators—abstaining from encroachments on
the rights and possessions of Carthage in Sicily. His oaths and
promises were delivered with so much apparent sincerity, accompanied
by emphatic harangues, that the people were persuaded to name him
general and guardian of the peace, for the purpose of realizing the
general aspirations towards harmony. Such appointment was recommended
(it seems) by Hamilkar.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931"
class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[p. 401]</span>All this train
of artifice had been concerted by Agathokles with Hamilkar, for the
purpose of enabling the former to seize the supreme power. As general
of the city, Agathokles had the direction of the military force.
Under the pretence of marching against some refractory exiles at
Erbita in the interior, he got together 3000 soldiers strenuously
devoted to him—mercenaries and citizens of desperate character—to
which Hamilkar added a reinforcement of Africans. As if about to
march forth, he mustered his troops at daybreak in the Timoleonteon
(chapel or precinct consecrated to Timoleon), while Peisarchus and
Dekles, two chiefs of the senate already assembled, were invited with
forty others to transact with him some closing business. Having these
men in his power, Agathokles suddenly turned upon them, and denounced
them to the soldiers as guilty of conspiring his death. Then,
receiving from the soldiers a response full of ardor, he ordered them
immediately to proceed to a general massacre of the senate and their
leading partisans, with full permission of licentious plunder in the
houses of these victims, the richest men in Syracuse. The soldiers
rushed into the street with ferocious joy to execute this order.
They slew not only the senators, but many others also, unarmed and
unprepared; each man selecting victims personally obnoxious to him.
They broke open the doors of the rich, or climbed over the roofs,
massacred the proprietors within, and ravished the females. They
chased the unsuspecting fugitives through the streets, not sparing
even those who took refuge in the temples. Many of these unfortunate
sufferers rushed for safety to the gates, but found them closed and
guarded by special order of Agathokles; so that they were obliged to
let themselves down from the walls, in which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span> many perished miserably. For two days
Syracuse was thus a prey to the sanguinary, rapacious, and lustful
impulses of the soldiery; four thousand citizens had been already
slain, and many more were seized as prisoners. The political purposes
of Agathokles, as well as the passions of the soldiers, being then
sated, he arrested the massacre. He concluded this bloody feat
by killing such of his prisoners as were most obnoxious to him,
and banishing the rest. The total number of expelled or fugitive
Syracusans is stated at 6000; who found a hospitable shelter and
home at Agrigentum. One act of lenity is mentioned, and ought
not to be omitted amidst this scene of horror. Deinokrates, one
among the prisoners, was liberated by Agathokles from motives of
former friendship: he too, probably, went into voluntary exile.<a
id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a></p>

<p>After a massacre thus perpetrated in the midst of profound peace,
and in the full confidence of a solemn act of mutual reconciliation
immediately preceding—surpassing the worst deeds of the elder
Dionysius, and indeed (we might almost say) of all other Grecian
despots—Agathokles convened what he called an assembly of the people.
Such of the citizens as were either oligarchical, or wealthy, or
in any way unfriendly to him, had been already either slain or
expelled; so that the assembly probably included few besides his own
soldiers: Agathokles, addressing them in terms of congratulation
on the recent glorious exploit, whereby they had purged the city
of its oligarchical tyrants—proclaimed that the Syracusan people
had now reconquered their full liberty. He affected to be weary
of the toils of command, and anxious only for a life of quiet
equality as one among the many; in token of which he threw off his
general’s cloak and put on a common civil garment. But those whom
he addressed, fresh from the recent massacre and plunder, felt that
their whole security depended upon the maintenance of his supremacy,
and loudly protested that they would not accept his resignation.
Agathokles, with pretended reluctance, told them, that if they
insisted, he would comply, but upon the peremptory condition of
enjoying a single-handed authority, without any colleagues or<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[p. 403]</span> counsellors for whose
misdeeds he was to be responsible. The assembly replied by conferring
upon him, with unanimous acclamations, the post of general with
unlimited power, or despot.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933"
class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>Thus was constituted a new despot of Syracuse about fifty years
after the decease of the elder Dionysius, and twenty-two years after
Timoleon had rooted out the Dionysian dynasty, establishing on its
ruins a free polity. On accepting the post, Agathokles took pains
to proclaim that he would tolerate no farther massacre or plunder,
and that his government would for the future be mild and beneficent.
He particularly studied to conciliate the poorer citizens, to whom
he promised abolition of debts and a new distribution of lands. How
far he carried out this project systematically, we do not know;
but he conferred positive donations on many of the poor—which he
had abundant means of doing, out of the properties of the numerous
exiles recently expelled. He was full of promises to every one,
displaying courteous and popular manners, and abstaining from all
ostentation of guards, or ceremonial attendants, or a diadem. He
at the same time applied himself vigorously to strengthen his
military and naval force, his magazines of arms and stores, and his
revenues. He speedily extended his authority over all the territorial
domain of Syracuse, with her subject towns, and carried his arms
successfully over many other parts of Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_934"
href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<p>The Carthaginian general Hamilkar, whose complicity or connivance
had helped Agathokles to this blood-stained elevation, appears
to have permitted him without opposition to extend his dominion
over a large portion of Sicily, and even to plunder the towns in
alliance with Carthage itself. Complaints having been made to
Carthage, this officer was superseded, and another general (also
named Hamilkar) was sent in his place. We are unable to trace in
detail the proceedings of Agathokles during the first years of his
despotism; but he went on enlarging his sway over the neighboring
cities, while the Syracusan exiles, whom he had expelled, found
a home partly at Agrigentum (under Deinokrates), partly at
Messênê. About the year 314 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we hear
that he made an attempt on Messênê, which he was on the point of
seizing, had he not been stopped by the interference of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[p. 404]</span> Carthaginians (perhaps
the newly-appointed Hamilkar), who now at length protested against
his violation of the convention; meaning (as we must presume, for
we know of no other convention) the oath which had been sworn by
Agathokles at Syracuse under the guarantee of the Carthaginians.<a
id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a>
Though thus disappointed at Messênê, Agathokles seized Abakænum—where
he slew the leading citizens opposed to him,—and carried on
his aggressions elsewhere so effectively, that the leaders at
Agrigentum, instigated by the Syracusan exiles there harbored, became
convinced of the danger of leaving such encroachments unresisted.<a
id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>
The people of Agrigentum came to the resolution of taking up arms on
behalf of the liberties of Sicily, and allied themselves with Gela
and Messênê for the purpose.</p>

<p>But the fearful example of Agathokles himself rendered them
so apprehensive of the dangers from any military leader, at once
native and energetic, that they resolved to invite a foreigner.
Some Syracusan exiles were sent to Sparta, to choose and invoke
some Spartan of eminence and ability, as Archidamus had recently
been called to Tarentum—and even more, as Timoleon had been brought
from Corinth, with results so signally beneficent. The old Spartan
king Kleomenes (of the Eurysthenid race) had a son Akrotatus,
then unpopular at home,<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937"
class="fnanchor">[937]</a> and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span> well disposed towards foreign warfare.
This prince, without even consulting the Ephors, listened at once to
the envoys, and left Peloponnesus with a small squadron, intending to
cross by Korkyra and the coast of Italy to Agrigentum. Unfavorable
winds drove him as far north as Apollonia, and delayed his arrival
at Tarentum; in which city, originally a Spartan colony, he met with
a cordial reception, and obtained a vote of twenty vessels to assist
his enterprise of liberating Syracuse from Agathokles. He reached
Agrigentum with favorable hopes, was received with all the honors
due to a Spartan prince, and undertook the command. Bitterly did he
disappoint his party. He was incompetent as a general; he dissipated
in presents or luxuries the money intended for the campaign,
emulating Asiatic despots; his conduct was arrogant, tyrannical,
and even sanguinary. The disgust which he inspired was brought to
a height, when he caused Sosistratus, the leader of the Syracusan
exiles, to be assassinated at a banquet. Immediately the exiles
rose in a body to avenge this murder; while Akrotatus, deposed by
the Agrigentines, only found safety in flight.<a id="FNanchor_938"
href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p>To this young Spartan prince, had he possessed a noble heart
and energetic qualities, there was here presented a career of
equal grandeur with that of Timoleon—against an enemy able indeed
and formidable, yet not so superior in force as to render success
impossible. It is melancholy to see Akrotatus, from simple
worthlessness of character, throwing away such an opportunity; at
a time when Sicily was the only soil on which a glorious Hellenic
career was still open—when no similar exploits were practicable
by any Hellenic leader in Central Greece, from the overwhelming
superiority of force possessed by the surrounding kings.</p>

<p>The misconduct of Akrotatus broke up all hopes of active
operations against Agathokles. Peace was presently concluded
with the latter by the Agrigentines and their allies, under the
mediation of the Carthaginian general Hamilkar. By the terms of
this convention, all the Greek cities in Sicily were declared
autonomous, yet under the hegemony of Agathokles; excepting<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p. 406]</span> only Himera, Selinus,
and Herakleia, which were actually, and were declared still to
continue, under Carthage. Messênê was the only Grecian city standing
aloof from this convention; as such, therefore still remaining open
to the Syracusan exiles. The terms were so favorable to Agathokles,
that they were much disapproved at Carthage.<a id="FNanchor_939"
href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> Agathokles,
recognized as chief and having no enemy in the field, employed
himself actively in strengthening his hold on the other cities, and
in enlarging his military means at home. He sent a force against
Messênê, to require the expulsion of the Syracusan exiles from that
city, and to procure at the same time the recall of the Messenian
exiles, partisans of his own, and companions of his army. His
generals extorted these two points from the Messenians. Agathokles,
having thus broken the force of Messênê, secured to himself the town
still more completely, by sending for those Messenian citizens who
had chiefly opposed him, and putting them all to death, as well as
his leading opponents at Tauromenium. The number thus massacred was
not less than six hundred.<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940"
class="fnanchor">[940]</a></p>

<p>It only remained for Agathokles to seize Agrigentum. Thither
he accordingly marched. But Deinokrates and the Syracusan exiles,
expelled from Messênê, had made themselves heard at Carthage,
insisting on the perils to that city from the encroachments of
Agathokles. The Carthaginians alarmed sent a fleet of sixty sail,
whereby alone Agrigentum, already under siege by Agathokles, was
preserved. The recent convention was now broken on all sides,
and Agathokles kept no farther measures with the Carthaginians.
He ravaged all their Sicilian territory, and destroyed some of
their forts; while the Carthaginians on their side made a sudden
descent with their fleet on the harbor of Syracuse. They could
achieve nothing more, however, than the capture of one Athenian
merchant-vessel, out of two there riding. They disgraced their
acquisition by the cruel act (not uncommon in Carthaginian warfare)
of cutting of the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[p.
407]</span> the captive crew; for which, in a few days, retaliation
was exercised upon the crews of some of their own ships, taken by
the cruisers of Agathokles.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941"
class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>The defence of Agrigentum now rested principally on the
Carthaginians in Sicily, who took up a position on the hill
called Eknomus—in the territory of Gela, a little to the west
of the Agrigentine border. Here Agathokles approached to offer
them battle—having been emboldened by two important successes
obtained over Deinokrates and the Syracusan exiles, near
Kentoripa and Gallaria.<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942"
class="fnanchor">[942]</a> So superior was his force, however, that
the Carthaginians thought it prudent to remain in their camp; and
Agathokles returned in triumph to Syracuse, where he adorned the
temples with his recently acquired spoils. The balance of force
was soon altered by the despatch of a large armament from Carthage
under Hamilkar, consisting of 130 ships of war, with numerous other
transport ships, carrying many soldiers—2000 native Carthaginians,
partly men of rank—10,000 Africans—1000 Campanian heavy-armed and
1000 Balearic slingers. The fleet underwent in its passage so
terrific a storm, that many of the vessels sunk with all on board,
and it arrived with very diminished numbers in Sicily. The loss
fell upon the native Carthaginian soldiers with peculiar severity;
insomuch that when the news reached Carthage, a public mourning was
proclaimed, and the city walls were hung with black serge.</p>

<p>Those who reached Sicily, however, were quite sufficient to
place Hamilkar in an imposing superiority of number as compared
with Agathokles. He encamped on or near Eknomus, summoned all the
reinforcements that his Sicilian allies could furnish, and collected
additional mercenaries; so that he was soon at the head of 40,000
infantry and 5000 cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943"
class="fnanchor">[943]</a> At the same time, a Carthaginian armed
squadron, detached to the strait of Messênê, fell in with twenty
armed ships belonging to Agathokles, and captured them all with
their crews. The Sicilian cities were held to Agathokles principally
by terror, and were likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[p.
408]</span> to turn against him, if the Carthaginians exhibited
sufficient strength to protect them. This the despot knew and
dreaded; especially respecting Gela, which was not far from the
Carthaginian camp. Had he announced himself openly as intending to
place a garrison in Gela, he feared that the citizens might forestall
him by calling in Hamilkar. Accordingly he detached thither, on
various pretences, several small parties of soldiers, who presently
found themselves united in a number sufficient to seize the town.
Agathokles then marched into Gela with his main force. Distrusting
the adherence of the citizens, he let loose his soldiers upon them,
massacred four thousand persons, and compelled the remainder, as a
condition of sparing their lives, to bring in to him all their money
and valuables. Having by this atrocity both struck universal terror
and enriched himself, he advanced onward towards the Carthaginian
camp, and occupied a hill called Phalarion opposite to it.<a
id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>
The two camps were separated by a level plain or valley nearly five
miles broad, through which ran the river Himera.<a id="FNanchor_945"
href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

<p>For some days of the hottest season (the dog-days), both armies
remained stationary, neither of them choosing to make the attack. At
length Agathokles gained what he thought a favorable opportunity.
A detachment from the Carthaginian camp sallied forth in pursuit
of some Grecian plunderers; Agathokles posted some men in ambush,
who fell upon this detachment unawares, threw it into disorder, and
pursued it back to the camp. Following up this partial success,
Agathokles brought forward his whole force, crossed the river Himera,
and began a general attack. This advance not being expected, the
Grecian assailants seemed at first on the point of succeeding.
They filled up a portion of the ditch, tore up the Stockade, and
were forcing their way into the camp. They were however repulsed
by redoubled efforts, and new troops coming up, on the part of the
defenders; mainly, too, by the very effective action of the 1000
Balearic slingers in Hamilkar’s army, who hurled stones weighing
a pound each, against which the Grecian armor was an inadequate
defence. Still Agathokles, noway discouraged, caused the attack to be
renewed on several points at once and with ap<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_409">[p. 409]</span>parent success, when a reinforcement
landed from Carthage—the expectation of which may perhaps have
induced Hamilkar to refrain from any general attack. These new troops
joined in the battle, coming upon the rear of the Greeks; who were
intimidated and disordered by such unforeseen assailants, while the
Carthaginians in their front, animated to more energetic effort,
first repulsed them from the camp, and then pressed them vigorously
back. After holding their ground for some time against their double
enemy, the Greeks at length fled in disorder back to their own camp,
recrossing the river Himera. The interval was between four and five
miles of nearly level ground, over which they were actively pursued
and severely handled by the Carthaginian cavalry, 5000 in number.
Moreover, in crossing the river, many of them drank eagerly, from
thirst, fatigue, and the heat of the weather; the saltness of the
water proved so destructive to them, that numerous dead bodies are
said to have been found unwounded on the banks.<a id="FNanchor_946"
href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> At length they
obtained shelter in their own camp, after a loss of 7000 men; while
the loss of the victors is estimated at 500.</p>

<p>Agathokles, after this great disaster, did not attempt to maintain
his camp, but set it on fire, and returned to Gela; which was well
fortified and provisioned, capable of a long defence. Here he
intended to maintain himself against Hamilkar, at least until the
Syracusan harvest (probably already begun) should be completed. But
Hamilkar, having ascertained the strength of Gela, thought it prudent
to refrain from a siege, and employed himself in operations for the
purpose of strengthening his party in Sicily. His great victory
at the Himera had produced the strongest effect upon many of the
Sicilian cities, who were held to Agathokles by no other bonds except
those of fear. Hamilkar issued conciliatory proclamations, inviting
them all to become his allies, and marching his troops towards
the most convenient points. Presently Kamarina, Leontini, Katana,
Tauromenium, Messênê, Abakænum, with several other smaller towns
and forts, sent to tender themselves as allies; and the conduct of
Hamilkar towards all was so mild and equitable, as to give universal
satisfaction. Agathokles appears to have been thus dispossessed<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[p. 410]</span> of most part of
the island, retaining little besides Gela and Syracuse. Even the
harbor of Syracuse was watched by a Carthaginian fleet, placed to
intercept foreign supplies. Returning to Syracuse after Hamilkar had
renounced all attempts on Gela, Agathokles collected the corn from
the neighborhood, and put the fortifications in the best state of
defence. He had every reason to feel assured that the Carthaginians,
encouraged by their recent success, and reinforced by allies from
the whole island, would soon press the siege of Syracuse with all
their energy; while for himself, hated by all, there was no hope
of extraneous support, and little hope of a successful defence.<a
id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></p>

<p>In this apparently desperate situation, he conceived the idea of
a novelty alike daring, ingenious, and effective; surrounded indeed
with difficulties in the execution, but promising, if successfully
executed, to change altogether the prospects of the war.</p>

<p>He resolved to carry a force across from Syracuse to Africa, and
attack the Carthaginians on their own soil. No Greek, so far as we
know, had ever conceived the like scheme before; no one certainly
had ever executed it. In the memory of man, the African territory of
Carthage had never been visited by hostile foot. It was known that
the Carthaginians would be not only unprepared to meet an attack at
home, but unable even to imagine it as practicable. It was known
that their territory was rich, and their African subjects harshly
treated, discontented, and likely to seize the first opportunity
for revolting. The landing of any hostile force near Carthage
would strike such a blow, as at least to cause the recall of the
Carthaginian armament in Sicily, and thus relieve Syracuse; perhaps
the consequences of it might be yet greater.</p>

<p>How to execute the scheme was the grand difficulty—for the
Carthaginians were superior not merely on land, but also at sea.
Agathokles had no chance except by keeping his purpose secret, and
even unsuspected. He fitted out an armament, announced as about
to sail forth from Syracuse on a secret expedition, against some
unknown town on the Sicilian coast. He selected for this purpose his
best troops, especially his horsemen, few of whom had been slain
at the battle of the Himera; he could not<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_411">[p. 411]</span> transport horses, but he put the
horsemen aboard with their saddles and bridles, entertaining full
assurance that he could procure horses in Africa. In selecting
soldiers for his expedition, he was careful to take one member from
many different families, to serve as hostage for the fidelity of
those left behind. He liberated, and enrolled among his soldiers,
many of the strongest and most resolute slaves. To provide the
requisite funds, his expedients were manifold; he borrowed from
merchants, seized the money belonging to orphans, stripped the
women of their precious ornaments, and even plundered the richest
temples. By all these proceedings, the hatred as well as fear towards
him was aggravated, especially among the more opulent families.
Agathokles publicly proclaimed, that the siege of Syracuse, which the
Carthaginians were now commencing, would be long and terrible—that
he and his soldiers were accustomed to hardships and could endure
them, but that those, who felt themselves unequal to the effort,
might retire with their properties while it was yet time. Many of
the wealthier families—to a number stated as 1600 persons—profited
by this permission; but as they were leaving the city, Agathokles
set his mercenaries upon them, slew them all, and appropriated their
possessions to himself.<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948"
class="fnanchor">[948]</a> By such tricks and enormities, he
provided funds enough for an armament of sixty ships, well filled
with soldiers. Not one of these soldiers knew where they were
going; there was a general talk about the madness of Agathokles;
nevertheless such was their confidence in his bravery and military
resource, that they obeyed his orders without asking questions. To
act as viceroy of Syracuse during his own absence, Agathokles named
Antander his brother, aided by an Ætolian officer named Erymnon.<a
id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a></p>

<p>The armament was equipped and ready, without any suspicion on the
part of the Carthaginian fleet blockading the harbor. It happened
one day that the approach of some corn-ships seduced this fleet
into a pursuit; the mouth of the harbor being thus left unguarded,
Agathokles took the opportunity of striking with his armament into
the open sea. As soon as the Carthaginian fleet saw him sailing
forth, they neglected the corn-ships,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_412">[p. 412]</span> and prepared for battle, which they
presumed that he was come to offer. To their surprise, he stood out
to sea as fast as he could; they then pushed out in pursuit of him,
but he had already got a considerable advance and strove to keep
it. Towards nightfall however they neared him so much, that he was
only saved by the darkness. During the night he made considerable
way; but on the next day there occurred an eclipse of the sun so
nearly total, that it became perfectly dark, and the stars were
visible. The mariners were so terrified at this phenomenon, that
all the artifice and ascendency of Agathokles were required to
inspire them with new courage. At length, after six days and nights,
they approached the coast of Africa. The Carthaginian ships had
pursued them at a venture, in the direction towards Africa; and they
appeared in sight, just as Agathokles was nearing the land. Strenuous
efforts were employed by the mariners on both sides to touch land
first; Agathokles secured that advantage, and was enabled to put
himself into such a posture of defence that he repulsed the attack
of the Carthaginian ships, and secured the disembarcation of his
own soldiers, at a point called the Latomiæ or Stone quarries.<a
id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a></p>

<p>After establishing his position ashore, and refreshing his
soldiers, the first proceeding of Agathokles was to burn his vessels;
a proceeding which seemed to carry an air of desperate boldness. Yet
in truth the ships were now useless—for, if he was unsuccessful on
land, they were not enough to enable him to return in the face of
the Carthaginian fleet; they were even worse than useless, since, if
he retained them, it was requisite that he should leave a portion of
his army to guard them, and thus enfeeble his means of action for
the really important achievements on land. Convening his soldiers
in assembly near the ships, he first offered a sacrifice to Demeter
and Persephonê—the patron goddesses of Sicily, and of Syracuse in
particular. He then apprised his soldiers, that during the recent
crossing and danger from the Carthaginian pursuers, he had addressed
a vow to these goddess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[p.
413]</span>es—engaging to make a burnt-offering of his ships in
their honor, if they would preserve him safe across to Africa. The
goddesses had granted this boon; they had farther, by favorably
responding to the sacrifice just offered, promised full success to
his African projects: it became therefore incumbent on him to fulfil
his vow with exactness. Torches being new brought, Agathokles took
one in his hand, and mounted on the stern of the admiral’s ship,
directing each of the trierarchs to do the like on his own ship. All
were set on fire simultaneously, amidst the sound of trumpets, and
the mingled prayers and shouts of the soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_951"
href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a></p>

<p>Though Agathokles had succeeded in animating his soldiers with a
factitious excitement, for the accomplishment of this purpose, yet
so soon as they saw the conflagration decided and irrevocable, thus
cutting off all their communication with home—their spirits fell, and
they began to despair of their prospects. Without allowing them time
to dwell upon the novelty of the situation, Agathokles conducted them
at once against the nearest Carthaginian town, called Megalê-Polis.<a
id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a>
His march lay for the most part through a rich territory in the
highest cultivation. The passing glance which we thus obtain into the
condition of the territory near Carthage is of peculiar interest;
more especially when contrasted with the desolation of the same
coast, now and for centuries past. The corn-land, the plantations
both of vines and olives, the extensive and well-stocked gardens,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span> size and
equipment of the farm buildings, the large outlay for artificial
irrigation, the agreeable country-houses belonging to wealthy
Carthaginians, etc., all excited the astonishment, and stimulated
the cupidity, of Agathokles and his soldiers. Moreover, the towns
were not only very numerous, but all open and unfortified, except
Carthage itself and a few others on the coast.<a id="FNanchor_953"
href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a></p>

<p>The Carthaginians, besides having little fear of invasion by
sea, were disposed to mistrust their subject cities, which they
ruled habitually with harshness and oppression.<a id="FNanchor_954"
href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> The Liby-Phenicians
appear to have been unused to arms—a race of timid cultivators and
traffickers, accustomed to subjection and practised in the deceit
necessary for lightening it.<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955"
class="fnanchor">[955]</a> Agathokles, having marched through
this land of abundance, assaulted Megalêpolis without delay. The
inhabitants, unprepared for attack, distracted with surprise
and terror, made little resistance. Agathokles easily took the
town, abandoning both the persons of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_415">[p. 415]</span> the inhabitants and all the rich
property within, to his soldiers; who enriched themselves with a
prodigious booty both from town and country—furniture, cattle,
and slaves. From hence he advanced farther southward to the town
called Tunês (the modern Tunis, at the distance of only fourteen
miles south-west of Carthage itself), which he took by storm in
like manner. He fortified Tunês as a permanent position; but he
kept his main force united in camp, knowing well that he should
presently have an imposing army against him in the field, and
severe battles to fight.<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956"
class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

<p>The Carthaginian fleet had pursued Agathokles during his crossing
from Syracuse, in perfect ignorance of his plans. When he landed
in Africa, on their own territory, and even burnt his fleet, they
at first flattered themselves with the belief that they held him
prisoner. But as soon as they saw him commence his march in military
array against Megalêpolis, they divined his real purposes, and were
filled with apprehension. Carrying off the brazen prow-ornaments of
his burnt and abandoned ships, they made sail for Carthage, sending
forward a swift vessel to communicate first what had occurred.
Before this vessel arrived, however, the landing of Agathokles had
been already made known at Carthage, where it excited the utmost
surprise and consternation; since no one supposed that he could have
accomplished such an adventure without having previously destroyed
the Carthaginian army and fleet in Sicily. From this extreme dismay
they were presently relieved by the arrival of the messengers from
their fleet; whereby they learnt the real<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_416">[p. 416]</span> state of affairs in Sicily. They now
made the best preparations in their power to resist Agathokles.
Hanno and Bomilkar, two men of leading families, were named generals
conjointly. They were bitter political rivals,—but this very
rivalry was by some construed as an advantage, since each would
serve as a check upon the other and as a guarantee to the state;
or, what is more probable, each had a party sufficiently strong to
prevent the separate election of the other.<a id="FNanchor_957"
href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> These two generals,
unable to wait for distant succors, led out the native forces of the
city, stated at 40,000 infantry, 1000 cavalry, derived altogether
from citizens and residents—with 2000 war-chariots. They took post
on an eminence (somewhere between Tunis and Carthage) not far from
Agathokles; Bomilkar commanding on the left, where the ground was so
difficult that he was unable to extend his front, and was obliged
to admit an unusual depth of files; while Hanno was on the right,
having in his front rank the Sacred Band of Carthage, a corps of 2500
distinguished citizens, better armed and braver than the rest. So
much did the Carthaginians outnumber the invaders—and so confident
were they of victory—that they carried with them 20,000 pairs of
handcuffs for their anticipated prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_958"
href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>Agathokles placed himself on the left, with 1000 chosen hoplites
round him, to combat the Sacred Band; the command of his right he
gave to his son Archagathus. His troops—Syracusans, miscellaneous
mercenary Greeks, Campanians or Samnites, Tuscans, and Gauls—scarcely
equalled in numbers one-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[p.
417]</span>half of the enemy. Some of the ships’ crews were even
without arms,—a deficiency, which Agathokles could only supply in
appearance, by giving to them the leather cases or wrappers of
shields, stretched out upon sticks. The outstretched wrappers thus
exhibited looked from a distance like shields; so that these men,
stationed in the rear, had the appearance of a reserve of hoplites.
As the soldiers however were still discouraged, Agathokles tried to
hearten them up by another device yet more singular, for which indeed
he must have made deliberate provision beforehand. In various parts
of the camp, he let fly a number of owls, which perched upon the
shields and helmets of the soldiers. These birds, the favorite of
Athênê, were supposed and generally asserted to promise victory; the
minds of the soldiers are reported to have been much reassured by the
sight.</p>

<p>The Carthaginian war-chariots and cavalry, which charged first,
made little or no impression; but the infantry of their right pressed
the Greeks seriously. Especially Hanno, with the Sacred Band around
him, behaved with the utmost bravery and forwardness, and seemed to
be gaining advantage, when he was unfortunately slain. His death not
only discouraged his own troops, but became fatal to the army, by
giving opportunity for treason to his colleague Bomilkar. This man
had long secretly meditated the project of rendering himself despot
of Carthage. As a means of attaining that end, he deliberately sought
to bring reverses upon her; and no sooner had he heard of Hanno’s
death, than he gave orders for his own wing to retreat. The Sacred
Band, though fighting with unshaken valor, were left unsupported,
attacked in rear as well as front, and compelled to give way along
with the rest. The whole Carthaginian army was defeated and driven
back to Carthage. Their camp fell into the hands of Agathokles,
who found among their baggage the very handcuffs which they had
brought for fettering their expected captives.<a id="FNanchor_959"
href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a></p>

<p>This victory made Agathokles for the time master of the open
country. He transmitted the news to Sicily, by a boat of thirty<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[p. 418]</span> oars, constructed
expressly for the purpose—since he had no ships of his own remaining.
Having fortified Tunês and established it as his central position,
he commenced operations along the eastern coast (Zeugitana and
Byzakium, as the northern and southern portions of it were afterwards
denominated by the Romans) against the towns dependent on Carthage.<a
id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p>In that city, meanwhile, all was terror and despondency in
consequence of the recent defeat. It was well known that the
African subjects generally entertained nothing but fear and
hatred towards the reigning city. Neither the native Libyans
or Africans,—nor the mixed race called Liby-Phœnicians, who
inhabited the towns<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961"
class="fnanchor">[961]</a>—could be depended on if their services
were really needed. The distress of the Carthaginians took the form
of religious fears and repentance. They looked back with remorse
on the impiety of their past lives, and on their omissions of duty
towards the gods. To the Tyrian Herakles, they had been slack in
transmitting the dues and presents required by their religion; a
backwardness which they now endeavored to make up by sending envoys
to Tyre, with prayers and supplications, with rich presents, and
especially with models in gold and silver of their sacred temples
and shrines. Towards Kronus, or Moloch, they also felt that they
had conducted themselves sinfully. The worship acceptable to that
god required the sacrifice of young children, born of free and
opulent parents, and even the choice child of the family. But
it was now found out, on investigation, that many parents had
recently put a fraud upon the god, by surreptitiously buying poor
children, feeding them well, and then sacrificing them as their
own. This discovery seemed at once to explain why Kronus had become
offended, and what had brought upon them the recent defeat. They
made an emphatic atonement, by selecting 200 children from the
most illustrious families in Carthage, and offering them up to
Kronus at a great public sacrifice; besides which, 300 parents,
finding themselves denounced for similar omissions in the past,
displayed their repentance by voluntarily immolating their own
children for the public safety. The statue of Kronus,—placed with
outstretched hands to receive the victim tendered to him, with
fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[p. 419]</span> immediately
underneath—was fed on that solemnity certainly with 200, and probably
with 500, living children.<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962"
class="fnanchor">[962]</a> By this monstrous holocaust the full
religious duty being discharged, and forgiveness obtained from the
god, the mental distress of the Carthaginians was healed.</p>

<p>Having thus relieved their consciences on the score of religious
obligation, the Carthaginians despatched envoys to Hamilkar in
Sicily, acquainting him with the recent calamity, desiring him
to send a reinforcement, and transmitting to him the brazen prow
ornaments taken from the ships of Agathokles. They at the same time
equipped a fresh army, with which they marched forth to attack
Tunês. Agathokles had fortified that town, and established a strong
camp before it; but he had withdrawn his main force to prosecute
operations against the maritime towns on<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_420">[p. 420]</span> the eastern coast of the territory of
Carthage. Among these towns, he first attacked Neapolis with success,
granting to the inhabitants favorable terms. He then advanced farther
southwards towards Adrumetum, of which he commenced the siege, with
the assistance of a neighboring Libyan prince named Elymas, who now
joined him. While Agathokles was engaged in the siege of Adrumetum,
the Carthaginians attacked his position at Tunês, drove his soldiers
out of the fortified camp into the town, and began to batter the
defences of the town itself. Apprised of this danger while besieging
Adrumetum, but nevertheless reluctant to raise the siege,—Agathokles
left his main army before it, stole away with only a few soldiers and
some camp-followers, and conducting them to an elevated spot—halfway
between Adrumetum and Tunês, yet visible from both—he caused them to
kindle at night upon this eminence a prodigious number of fires.<a
id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a>
The effect, of these fires, seen from Adrumetum on one side and
from Tunês on the other, was, to produce the utmost terror at both
places. The Carthaginians besieging Tunês fancied that Agathokles
with his whole army was coming to attack them, and forthwith
abandoned the siege in disorder, leaving their engines behind. The
defenders of Adrumetum, interpreting these fires as evidence of a
large reinforcement on its way to join the besieging army, were
so discouraged that they surrendered the town on capitulation.<a
id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[p. 421]</span>By this same
stratagem—if the narrative can be trusted—Agathokles both relieved
Tunês, and acquired possession of Adrumetum. Pushing his conquests
yet farther south, he besieged and took Thapsus, with several
other towns on the coast to a considerable distance southward.<a
id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> He
also occupied and fortified the important position called Aspis, on
the south-east of the headland Cape Bon, and not far distant from
it; a point convenient for maritime communication with Sicily.<a
id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a></p>

<p>By a series of such acquisitions, comprising in all not less
than 200 dependencies of Carthage, Agathokles became master along
the eastern coast.<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967"
class="fnanchor">[967]</a> He next endeavored to subdue the
towns in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[p. 422]</span> the
interior, into which he advanced as far as several days’ march.
But he was recalled by intelligence from his soldiers at Tunês,
that the Carthaginians had marched out again to attack them, and
had already retaken some of his conquests. Returning suddenly by
forced marches, he came upon them by surprise, and drove in their
advanced parties with considerable loss; while he also gained an
important victory over the Libyan prince Elymas, who had rejoined the
Carthaginians, but was now defeated and slain.<a id="FNanchor_968"
href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> The Carthaginians,
however, though thus again humbled and discouraged, still maintained
the field, strongly entrenched, between Carthage and Tunês.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the affairs of Agathokles at Syracuse had taken a
turn unexpectedly favorable. He had left that city blocked up
partially by sea and with a victorious enemy encamped near it; so
that supplies found admission with difficulty. In this condition,
Hamilkar, commander of the Carthaginian army, received from
Carthage the messengers announcing their recent defeat in Africa;
yet also bringing the brazen prow ornaments taken from the ships
of Agathokles. He ordered the envoys to conceal the real truth,
and to spread abroad news that Agathokles had been destroyed with
his armament; in proof of which he produced the prow ornaments,—an
undoubted evidence that the ships had really been destroyed. Sending
envoys with these evidences into Syracuse, to be exhibited to
Antander, and the ether authorities, Hamilkar demanded from them
the surrender of the city, under promise of safety and favorable
terms; at the same time marching his army close up to it, with
the view of making an attack. Antander with others, believing
the information and despairing of successful resistance, were
disposed to comply; but Erymnon the Ætolian insisted on holding out
until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[p. 423]</span> they had
fuller certainty. This resolution Antander adopted. At the same
time, mistrusting those citizens of Syracuse who were relatives or
friends of the exiles without, he ordered them all to leave the
city immediately, with their wives and families. No less than 8000
persons were expelled under this mandate. They were consigned to the
mercy of Hamilkar, and his army without; who not only suffered them
to pass, but treated them with kindness. Syracuse was now a scene
of aggravated wretchedness and despondency; not less from this late
calamitous expulsion, than from the grief of those who believed that
their relatives in Africa had perished with Agathokles. Hamilkar had
brought up his battering-engines, and was preparing to assault the
town, when Nearchus, the messenger from Agathokles, arrived from
Africa after a voyage of five days, having under favor of darkness
escaped, though only just escaped, the blockading squadron. From him
the Syracusan government learnt the real truth, and the victorious
position of Agathokles. There was no farther talk of capitulation;
Hamilkar—having tried a partial assault, which was vigorously
repulsed,—withdrew his army, and detached from it a reinforcement of
5000 men to the aid of his countrymen in Africa.<a id="FNanchor_969"
href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a></p>

<p>During some months, he seems to have employed himself in partial
operations for extending the Carthaginian dominion throughout
Sicily. But at length he concerted measures with the Syracusan
exile Deinokrates, who was at the head of a numerous body of his
exiled countrymen, for a renewed attack upon Syracuse. His fleet
already blockaded the harbor, and he now with his army, stated as
120,000 men, destroyed the neighboring lands, hoping to starve
out the inhabitants. Approaching close to the walls of the city,
he occupied the Olympieion, or temple of Zeus Olympius, near the
river Anapus and the interior coast of the Great Harbor. From
hence—probably under the conduct of Deinokrates and the other exiles,
well-acquainted with the ground—he undertook by a night-march to
ascend the circuitous and difficult mountain track, for the purpose
of surprising the fort called Euryalus, at the highest point of
Epipolæ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[p. 424]</span> and the
western apex of the Syracusan lines of fortification. This was the
same enterprise, at the same hour, and with the same main purpose,
as that of Demosthenes during the Athenian siege, after he had
brought the second armament from Athens to the relief of Nikias.<a
id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a>
Even Demosthenes, though conducting his march with greater
precaution than Hamilkar, and successful in surprising the fort
of Euryalus, had been driven down again with disastrous loss.
Moreover, since his time, this fort Euryalus, instead of being left
detached, had been embodied by the elder Dionysius as an integral
portion of the fortifications of the city. It formed the apex
or point of junction for the two converging walls—one skirting
the northern cliff, the other the southern cliff, of Epipolæ.<a
id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>
The surprise intended by Hamilkar—difficult in the extreme, if at
all practicable—seems to have been unskilfully conducted. It was
attempted with a confused multitude, incapable of that steady order
requisite for night-movements. His troops, losing their way in the
darkness, straggled, and even mistook each other for enemies; while
the Syracusan guards from Euryalus, alarmed by the noise, attacked
them vigorously and put them to the rout. Their loss, in trying
to escape down the steep declivity, was prodigious; and Hamilkar
himself, making brave efforts to rally them, became prisoner to
the Syracusans. What lent peculiar interest to this incident, in
the eyes of a pious Greek, was that it served to illustrate and
confirm the truth of prophecy. Hamilkar had been assured by a
prophet that he would sup that night in Syracuse; and this assurance
had in part emboldened him to the attack, since he naturally
calculated on entering the city as a conqueror.<a id="FNanchor_972"
href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> He did indeed take
his evening meal in Syracuse, literally fulfilling the augury.
Immediately after it, he was handed over to the relatives of the
slain, who first paraded him through the city<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_425">[p. 425]</span> in chains, then inflicted on him
the worst tortures, and lastly killed him. His head was cut off
and sent to Africa.<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973"
class="fnanchor">[973]</a></p>

<p>The loss and humiliation sustained in this repulse—together
with the death of Hamilkar, and the discord ensuing between the
exiles under Deinokrates and the Carthaginian soldiers—completely
broke up the besieging army. At the same time, the Agrigentines,
profiting by the depression both of Carthaginians and exiles, stood
forward publicly, proclaiming themselves as champions of the cause
of autonomous city government throughout Sicily, under their own
presidency, against both the Carthaginians on one side, and the
despot Agathokles on the other. They chose for their general a
citizen named Xenodokus, who set himself with vigor to the task of
expelling everywhere the mercenary garrisons which held the cities in
subjection. He began first with Gela, the city immediately adjoining
Agrigentum, found a party of the citizens disposed to aid him, and
in conjunction with them, overthrew the Agathoklean garrison. The
Geloans, thus liberated, seconded cordially his efforts to extend the
like benefits to others. The popular banner proclaimed by Agrigentum
proved so welcome, that many cities eagerly invited her aid to shake
off the yoke of the soldiery in their respective citadels, and regain
their free governments.<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974"
class="fnanchor">[974]</a> Enna, Erbessus, Echetla,<a
id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a>
Leontini, and Kamarina, were all thus relieved from the dominion
of Agathokles; while other cities were in like manner emancipated
from the sway of the Carthaginians; and joined the Agrigentine
confederacy. The Agathoklean government at Syracuse was not strong
enough to resist such spirited manifestations. Syracuse still
continued to be blocked up by the Carthaginian fleet; though the
blockade was less efficacious, and supplies were now introduced more
abundantly than before.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976"
class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[p. 426]</span>The ascendency
of Agathokles was thus rather on the wane in Sicily: but in Africa,
he had become more powerful than ever—not without perilous hazards
which brought him occasionally to the brink of ruin. On receiving
from Syracuse the head of the captive Hamilkar, he rode forth
close to the camp of the Carthaginians, and held it up to their
view in triumph; they made respectful prostration before it, but
the sight was astounding and mournful to them.<a id="FNanchor_977"
href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> While they were thus
in despondency, however, a strange vicissitude was on the point of
putting their enemy into their hands. A violent mutiny broke out in
the camp of Agathokles at Tunês, arising out of a drunken altercation
between his son Archagathus and an Ætolian officer named Lykiskus;
which ended in the murder of the latter by the former. The comrades
of Lykiskus rose in arms with fury to avenge him, calling for the
head of Archagathus. They found sympathy with the whole army; who
seized the opportunity of demanding their arrears of outstanding
pay, chose new generals, and took regular possession of Tunês with
its defensive works. The Carthaginians, informed of this outbreak,
immediately sent envoys to treat with the mutineers, offering to
them large presents and double pay in the service of Carthage.
Their offer was at first so favorably entertained, that the envoys
returned with confident hopes of success; when Agathokles, as a
last resource, clothed himself in mean garb, and threw himself on
the mercy of the soldiers. He addressed them in a pathetic appeal,
imploring them not to desert him, and even drew his sword to kill
himself before their faces. With such art did he manage this scene,
that the feelings of the soldiers underwent a sudden and complete
revolution. They not only became reconciled to him, but even greeted
him with enthusiasm, calling on him to resume the dress and functions
of general, and promising unabated obedience for the future.<a
id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>
Agathokles gladly obeyed the call, and took advan<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[p. 427]</span>tage of their renewed
ardor to attack forthwith the Carthaginians; who, expecting nothing
less, were defeated with considerable loss.<a id="FNanchor_979"
href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a></p>

<p>In spite of this check, the Carthaginians presently sent a
considerable force into the interior, for the purpose of reconquering
or regaining the disaffected Numidian tribes. They met with good
success in this enterprise; but the Numidians were in the main
faithless and indifferent to both the belligerents, seeking only
to turn the war to their own profit. Agathokles, leaving his son
in command at Tunês, followed the Carthaginians into the interior
with a large portion of his army. The Carthaginian generals were
cautious, and kept themselves in strong position. Nevertheless
Agathokles felt confident enough to assail them in their camp; and
after great effort, with severe loss on his own side, he gained an
indecisive victory. This advantage however was countervailed by
the fact, that during the action the Numidians assailed his camp,
slew all the defenders, and carried off nearly all the slaves and
baggage. The loss on the Carthaginian side fell most severely upon
the Greek soldiers in their pay; most of them exiles under Klinon,
and some Syracusan exiles. These men behaved with signal gallantry,
and were nearly all slain, either during the battle or after the
battle, by Agathokles.<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980"
class="fnanchor">[980]</a></p>

<p>It had now become manifest, however, to this daring invader
that the force of resistance possessed by Carthage was more than
he could overcome—that though humbling and impoverishing her for
the moment, he could not bring the war to a triumphant close;
since the city itself, occupying the isthmus of a peninsula from
sea to sea, and surrounded with the strongest fortifications,
could not be besieged except by means far superior to his.<a
id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>
We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[p. 428]</span> have already
seen, that though he had gained victories and seized rich plunder,
he had not been able to provide even regular pay for his soldiers,
whose fidelity was consequently precarious. Nor could he expect
reinforcements from Sicily; where his power was on the whole
declining, though Syracuse itself was in less danger than before.
He therefore resolved to invoke aid from Ophellas at Kyrênê and
despatched Orthon as envoy for that purpose.<a id="FNanchor_982"
href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p>To Kyrênê and what was afterwards called its Pentapolis (i. e.
the five neighboring Grecian towns, Kyrênê, its port Apollonia,
Barka, Teucheira, and Hesperides), an earlier chapter of this history
has already been devoted.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983"
class="fnanchor">[983]</a> Unfortunately information respecting
them, for a century and more anterior to Alexander the Great, is
almost wholly wanting. Established among a Libyan population, many
of whom were domiciliated with the Greeks as fellow-residents,
these Kyreneans had imbibed many Libyan habits in war, in peace,
and in religion; of which their fine breed of horses, employed both
for the festival chariot-matches and in battle, was one example.
The Libyan tribes, useful as neighbors, servants, and customers,<a
id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a>
were frequently also troublesome as enemies. In 413
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> we hear accidentally that Hesperides
was besieged by Libyan tribes, and rescued by some Peloponnesian
hoplites on their way to Syracuse during the Athenian siege.<a
id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a>
About 401 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (shortly after the close of
the Peloponnesian war), the same city was again so hard pressed
by the same enemies, that she threw open her citizenship to any
Greek new-comer who would aid in repelling them. This invitation
was accepted by several of the Messenians, just then expelled from
Peloponnesus, and proscribed by the Spartans; they went to Africa,
but, becoming involved in intestine warfare among the citizens of
Kyrênê, a large proportion of them perished.<a id="FNanchor_986"
href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> Except these
scanty notices, we hear nothing about the Greco-Libyan Pentapolis
in relation to Grecian affairs, before<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_429">[p. 429]</span> the time of Alexander. It would appear
that the trade with the native African tribes, between the Gulfs
called the Greater and Lesser Syrtis, was divided between Kyrênê
(meaning the Kyrenaic Pentapolis) and Carthage—at a boundary point
called the Altars of the Philæni, ennobled by a commemorative legend;
immediately east of these Altars was Automala, the westernmost
factory of Kyrênê.<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987"
class="fnanchor">[987]</a> We cannot doubt that the relations,
commercial and otherwise, between Kyrênê and Carthage, the two
great emporia on the coast of Africa, were constant and often
lucrative—though not always friendly.</p>

<p>In the year 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, when the victorious
Alexander overran Egypt, the inhabitants of Kyrênê sent to
tender presents and submission to him, and became enrolled
among his subjects.<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988"
class="fnanchor">[988]</a> We hear nothing more about them until the
last year of Alexander’s life (324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> to 323
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). About that time, the exiles from Kyrênê
and Barka, probably enough emboldened by the rescript of Alexander
(proclaimed at the Olympic festival of 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
and directing that all Grecian exiles, except those guilty of
sacrilege, should be recalled forthwith), determined to accomplish
their return by force. To this end they invited from Krete an officer
named Thimbron; who, having slain Harpalus after his flight from
Athens (recounted in a <a href="#Thimbron">previous chapter</a>),
had quartered himself in Krete, with the treasure, the ships, and
the 6000 mercenaries, brought over from Asia by that satrap.<a
id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a>
Thimbron willingly carried over his army to their assistance,
intending to conquer for himself a principality in Libya. He landed
near Kyrênê, defeated the Kyrenean forces with great slaughter, and
made himself master of Apollonia, the fortified port of that city,
distant from it nearly ten miles. The towns of Barka and Hesperides
sided with him; so that he was strong enough to force the Kyreneans
to a disadvantageous treaty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[p.
430]</span> They covenanted to pay 500 talents,—to surrender to
him half of their war-chariots for his ulterior projects—and to
leave him in possession of Apollonia. While he plundered the
merchants in the harbor, he proclaimed his intention of subjugating
the independent Libyan tribes, and probably of stretching his
conquests to Carthage.<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990"
class="fnanchor">[990]</a> His schemes were however frustrated by one
of his own officers, a Kretan named Mnasikles; who deserted to the
Kyreneans, and encouraged them to set aside the recent convention.
Thimbron, after seizing such citizens of Kyrênê as happened to be
at Apollonia, attacked Kyrênê itself, but was repulsed; and the
Kyreneans were then bold enough to invade the territory of Barka
and Hesperides. To aid them, Thimbron moved his quarters from
Apollonia; but during his absence, Mnasikles contrived to surprise
that valuable port; thus mastering at once his base of operations,
the station for his fleet, and all the baggage of his soldiers.
Thimbron’s fleet could not be long maintained without a harbor. The
seamen, landing here and there for victuals and water, were cut off
by the native Libyans, while the vessels were dispersed by storms.<a
id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

<p>The Kyreneans, now full of hope, encountered Thimbron in the
field, and defeated him. Yet though reduced to distress, he contrived
to obtain possession of Teucheira; to which port he invoked as
auxiliaries 2500 fresh soldiers, out of the loose mercenary bands
dispersed near Cape Tænarus in Peloponnesus. This reinforcement
again put him in a condition for battle. The Kyreneans on their
side also thought it necessary to obtain succor, partly from the
neighboring Libyans, partly from Carthage. They got together a force
stated as 30,000 men, with which they met him in the field. But, on
this occasion they were totally routed, with the loss of all their
generals and much of their army. Thimbron was now in the full tide
of success; he pressed both Kyrênê and the harbor so vigorously,
that famine began to prevail, and sedition broke out among the
citizens. The oligarchical men, expelled by the more popular party,
sought shelter, some in the camp of Thimbron; some at the court
of Ptolemy in Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992"
class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[p. 431]</span>I have already
mentioned, that in the partition after the decease of Alexander,
Egypt had been assigned to Ptolemy. Seizing with eagerness the
opportunity of annexing to it so valuable a possession as the
Kyrenaic Pentapolis, this chief sent an adequate force under Ophellas
to put down Thimbron and restore the exiles. His success was
complete. All the cities in the Pentapolis were reduced; Thimbron,
worsted and pursued as a fugitive, was seized in his flight by
some Libyans, and brought prisoner to Teucheira; the citizens of
which place (by permission of the Olynthian Epikydes, governor for
Ptolemy), first tortured him, and then conveyed him to Apollonia to
be hanged. A final visit from Ptolemy himself regulated the affairs
of the Pentapolis, which were incorporated with his dominions
and placed under the government of Ophellas.<a id="FNanchor_993"
href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a></p>

<p>It was thus that the rich and flourishing Kyrênê, an interesting
portion of the once autonomous Hellenic world, passed like the
rest under one of the Macedonian Diadochi. As the proof and
guarantee of this new sovereignty, we find erected within the
walls of the city, a strong and completely detached citadel,
occupied by a Macedonian or Egyptian garrison (like Munychia at
Athens), and forming the stronghold of the viceroy. Ten years
afterwards (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 312) the Kyreneans made an
attempt to emancipate themselves, and besieged this citadel; but
being again put down by an army and fleet which Ptolemy despatched
under Agis from Egypt,<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994"
class="fnanchor">[994]</a> Kyrênê passed once more under the
vice-royalty of Ophellas.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995"
class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p>To this viceroy Agathokles now sent envoys, invoking his aid
against Carthage. Ophellas was an officer of consideration and
experience. He had served under Alexander, and had married an
Athenian wife, Euthydikê,—a lineal descendant from Mil<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[p. 432]</span>tiades the victor of
Marathon, and belonging to a family still distinguished at Athens.
In inviting Ophellas to undertake jointly the conquest of Carthage,
the envoys proposed that he should himself hold it when conquered.
Agathokles (they said) wished only to overthrow the Carthaginian
dominion in Sicily, being well aware that he could not hold that
island in conjunction with an African dominion. To Ophellas,<a
id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>
such an invitation proved extremely seducing. He was already on
the look out for aggrandizement towards the west, and had sent an
exploring nautical expedition along the northern coast of Africa,
even to some distance round and beyond the Strait of Gibraltar.<a
id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a>
Moreover, to all military adventurers, both on sea and on land, the
season was one of boundless speculative promise. They had before
them not only the prodigious career of Alexander himself, but the
successful encroachments of the great officers his successors. In
the second distribution, made at Triparadeisus, of the Alexandrine
empire, Antipater had assigned to Ptolemy not merely Egypt and
Libya, but also an undefined amount of territory west of Libya, to
be afterwards acquired;<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998"
class="fnanchor">[998]</a> the conquest of which was known to have
been among the projects of Alexander, had he lived longer. To this
conquest Ophellas was now specially called, either as the viceroy or
the independent equal of Ptolemy, by the invitation of Agathokles.
Having learnt in the service of Alexander not to fear long marches,
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[p. 433]</span> embraced the
proposition with eagerness. He undertook an expedition from Kyrênê on
the largest scale. Through his wife’s relatives, he was enabled to
make known his projects at Athens, where, as well as in other parts
of Greece, they found much favor. At this season, the Kassandrian
oligarchies were paramount not only at Athens, but generally
throughout Greece. Under the prevalent degradation and suffering,
there was ample ground for discontent, and no liberty of expressing
it; many persons therefore were found disposed either to accept
army-service with Ophellas, or to enrol themselves in a foreign
colony under his auspices. To set out under the military protection
of this powerful chief—to colonize the mighty Carthage, supposed to
be already enfeebled by the victories of Agathokles—to appropriate
the wealth, the fertile landed possessions, and the maritime
position, of her citizens—was a prize well calculated to seduce
men dissatisfied with their homes, and not well informed of the
intervening difficulties.<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999"
class="fnanchor">[999]</a></p>

<p>Under such hopes, many Grecian colonists joined Ophellas at
Kyrênê, some even with wives and children. The total number is
stated at 10,000. Ophellas conducted them forth at the head of
a well appointed army of 10,000 infantry, 600 cavalry, and 100
war-chariots; each chariot carrying the driver and two fighting men.
Marching with this miscellaneous body of soldiers and colonists, he
reached in eighteen days the post of Automalæ—the westernmost factory
of Kyrênê.<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000"
class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> From thence he proceeded westward along
the shore between the two Syrtes, in many parts a sandy, trackless
desert, without wood and almost without water (with the exception
of particular points of fertility), and infested by serpents many
and venomous. At one time, all his provisions were exhausted; he
passed through the territory of the natives called Lotophagi,
near the lesser Syrtis; where the army had<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_434">[p. 434]</span> nothing to eat except the fruit
of the lotus, which there abounded.<a id="FNanchor_1001"
href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> Ophellas met
with no enemies; but the sufferings of every kind endured by his
soldiers—still more of course by the less hardy colonists and their
families—were most distressing. After miseries endured for more than
two months, he joined Agathokles in the Carthaginian territory; With
what abatement of number, we do not know, but his loss must have been
considerable.<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002"
class="fnanchor">[1002]</a></p>

<p>Ophellas little knew the man whose invitation and alliance he
had accepted. Agathokles at first received him with the warmest
protestations of attachment, welcoming the new-comers with profuse
hospitality, and supplying to them full means of refreshment and
renovation after their past sufferings. Having thus gained the
confidence and favorable sympathies of all, he proceeded to turn it
to his own purposes. Convening suddenly the most devoted among his
own soldiers, he denounced Ophellas as guilty of plotting against
his life. They listened to him with the same feelings of credulous
rage as the Macedonian soldiers exhibited when Alexander denounced
Philotas before them. Agathokles then at once called them to arms,
set upon Ophellas unawares, and slew him with his more immediate
defenders. Among the soldiers of Ophellas, this act excited horror
and indignation, no less than surprise; but Agathokles at length
succeeded in bringing them to terms, partly by deceitful pretexts,
partly by intimidation: for this unfortunate army, left without any
commander of fixed purpose, had no resource except to enter into
his service.<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003"
class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> He thus found himself (like
Antipater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[p. 435]</span> after
the death of Leonnatus) master of a double army, and relieved from
a troublesome rival. The colonists of Ophellas—more unfortunate
still, since they could be of no service to Agathokles—were put by
him on board some merchant vessels, which he was sending to Syracuse
with spoil. The weather becoming stormy, many of these vessels
foundered at sea,—some were driven off and wrecked on the coast of
Italy—and a few only reached Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_1004"
href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> Thus miserably
perished the Kyrenean expedition of Ophellas; one of the most
commanding and powerful schemes, for joint conquest and colonization,
that ever set out from any Grecian city.</p>

<p>It would have fared ill with Agathokles, had the Carthaginians
been at hand, and ready to attack him in the confusion immediately
succeeding the death of Ophellas. It would also have fared yet
worse with Carthage, had Agathokles been in a position to attack
her during the terrible sedition excited, nearly at the same time,
within her walls by the general Bomilkar.<a id="FNanchor_1005"
href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> This traitor
(as has been already stated) had long cherished the design to render
himself despot, and had been watching for a favorable opportunity.
Having purposely caused the loss of the first battle—fought in
conjunction with his brave colleague Hanno, against Agathokles—he
had since carried on the war with a view to his own project (which
explains in part the continued reverses of the Carthaginians); he
now thought that the time was come for openly raising his standard.
Availing himself of a military muster in the quarter of the city
called Neapolis, he first dismissed the general body of the
soldiers, retaining near him only a trusty band of 500 citizens,
and 4000 mercenaries. At the head of these, he then fell upon
the unsuspecting city: dividing them into five detachments, and
slaughtering indiscriminately the unarmed citizens in the streets,
as well as in the great market-place. At first the Carthaginians
were astounded and paralyzed. Gradually however they took courage,
stood upon their defence against the assailants, combatted them in
the streets and poured upon them missiles from the house-tops. After
a prolonged conflict, the partisans of Bomilkar found themselves
worsted, and were glad to avail themselves of the mediation of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[p. 436]</span> some elder citizens.
They laid down their arms on promise of pardon. The promise was
faithfully kept by the victors, except in regard to Bomilkar himself;
who was hanged in the market-place, having first undergone severe
tortures.<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006"
class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>Though the Carthaginians had thus escaped from an extreme
peril, yet the effects of so formidable a conspiracy weakened them
for some time against their enemy without; while Agathokles on
the other hand, reinforced by the army from Kyrênê, was stronger
than ever. So elate did he feel, that he assumed the title of
King;<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007"
class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> following herein the example of the great
Macedonian officers, Antigonus, Ptolemy, Seleukus, Lysimachus, and
Kassander; the memory of Alexander being now discarded, as his heirs
had been already put to death. Agathokles, already master of nearly
all the dependent towns east and south-east of Carthage, proceeded to
carry his arms to the north-west of the city. He attacked Utica,—the
second city next to Carthage in importance, and older indeed than
Carthage itself—situated on the western or opposite shore of the
Carthaginian Gulf, and visible from Carthage, though distant from it
twenty-seven miles around the Gulf on land.<a id="FNanchor_1008"
href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> The Uticans
had hitherto remained faithful to Carthage, in spite of her
reverses, and of defection elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_1009"
href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> Agathokles
marched into their territory with such<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_437">[p. 437]</span> unexpected rapidity (he had hitherto
been on the south-east of Carthage, and he now suddenly moved to
the north-west of that city), that he seized the persons of three
hundred leading citizens, who had not yet taken the precaution of
retiring within the city. Having vainly tried to prevail on the
Uticans to surrender, he assailed their walls, attaching in front
of his battering engines the three hundred Utican prisoners; so
that the citizens, in hurling missiles of defence, were constrained
to inflict death on their own comrades and relatives. They
nevertheless resisted the assault with unshaken resolution; but
Agathokles found means to force an entrance through a weak part of
the walls, and thus became master of the city. He made it a scene
of indiscriminate slaughter, massacring the inhabitants, armed and
unarmed, and hanging up the prisoners. He further captured the town
of Hippu-Akra, about thirty miles north-west of Utica, which had also
remained faithful to Carthage—and which now, after a brave defence,
experienced the like pitiless treatment.<a id="FNanchor_1010"
href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> The
Carthaginians, seemingly not yet recovered from their recent shock,
did not interfere, even to rescue these two important places; so that
Agathokles, firmly established in Tunês as a centre of operations,
extended his African dominion more widely than ever all round
Carthage, both on the coast and in the interior; while he interrupted
the supplies of Carthage itself, and reduced the inhabitants to great
privations.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011"
class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> He even occupied and fortified strongly
a place called Hippagreta, between Utica and Carthage; thus
pushing his posts within a short distance both east and west of
her gates.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012"
class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[p. 438]</span>In this
prosperous condition of his African affairs, he thought the
opportunity favorable for retrieving his diminished ascendency in
Sicily; to which island he accordingly crossed over, with 2000 men,
leaving the command in Africa to his son Archagathus. That young
man was at first successful, and seemed even in course of enlarging
his father’s conquests. His general Eumachus overran a wide range
of interior Numidia, capturing Tokæ, Phellinê, Meschelæ, Akris, and
another town bearing the same name of Hippu-Akra—and enriching his
soldiers with a considerable plunder. But in a second expedition,
endeavoring to carry his arms yet farther into the interior, he
was worsted in an attack upon a town called Miltinê, and compelled
to retreat. We read that he marched through one mountainous region
abounding in wild cats—and another, in which there were a great
number of apes, who lived in the most tame and familiar manner in
the houses with men—being greatly caressed, and even worshipped
as gods.<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013"
class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>The Carthaginians however had now regained internal harmony and
power of action. Their senate and their generals were emulous, both
in vigor and in provident combinations, against the common enemy.
They sent forth 30,000 men, a larger force than they had yet had in
the field; forming three distinct camps, under Hanno, Imilkon, and
Adherbal, partly in the interior, partly on the coast. Archagathus,
leaving a sufficient guard at Tunês, marched to meet them,
distributing his army in three divisions also; two, under himself
and Æschrion, besides the corps under Eumachus in the mountainous
region. He was however unsuccessful at all points. Hanno, contriving
to surprise the division of Æschrion, gained a complete victory,
wherein Æschrion himself with more than 4000 men were slain.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[p. 439]</span> Imilkon was yet more
fortunate in his operations against Eumachus, whom he entrapped by
simulated flight into an ambuscade, and attacked at such advantage,
that the Grecian army was routed and cut off from all retreat. A
remnant of them defended themselves for some time on a neighboring
hill, but being without water, nearly all soon perished, from thirst,
fatigue, and the sword of the conqueror.<a id="FNanchor_1014"
href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<p>By such reverses, destroying two-thirds of the Agathoklean
army, Archagathus was placed in serious peril. He was obliged to
concentrate his force in Tunês, calling in nearly all his outlying
detachments. At the same time, those Liby-Phenician cities, and
rural Libyan tribes, who had before joined Agathokles, now detached
themselves from him when his power was evidently declining, and made
their peace with Carthage. The victorious Carthaginian generals
established fortified camps round Tunês, so as to restrain the
excursions of Archagathus; while with their fleet they blocked up
his harbor. Presently provisions became short, and much despondency
prevailed among the Grecian army. Archagathus transmitted this
discouraging news to his father in Sicily, with urgent entreaties
that he would come to the rescue.<a id="FNanchor_1015"
href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a></p>

<p>The career of Agathokles in Sicily, since his departure from
Africa, had been checkered, and on the whole unproductive. Just
before his arrival in the island,<a id="FNanchor_1016"
href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> his
generals Leptines and Demophilus had gained an important victory
over the Agrigentine forces commanded by Xenodokus, who were
disabled from keeping the field. This disaster was a fatal
discouragement both to the Agrigentines, and to the cause which
they had espoused as champions—free and autonomous city-government
with equal confederacy for self-defence, under the presidency of
Agrigentum.<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017"
class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> The outlying cities confederate with
Agrigentum were left without military protection, and exposed to
the attacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[p. 440]</span>
of Leptines, animated and fortified by the recent arrival of
his master Agathokles. That despot landed at Selinus—subdued
Herakleia, Therma, and Kephaloidion, on or near the northern coast
of Sicily—then crossed the interior of the island to Syracuse. In
his march he assaulted Kentoripa, having some partisans within, but
was repulsed with loss. At Apollonia,<a id="FNanchor_1018"
href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> he was
also unsuccessful in his first attempt; but being stung with
mortification, he resumed the assault next day, and at length, by
great efforts, carried the town. To avenge his loss, which had been
severe, he massacred most of the citizens, and abandoned the town
to plunder.<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019"
class="fnanchor">[1019]</a></p>

<p>From hence he proceeded to Syracuse, which he now revisited
after an absence of (apparently) more than two years in Africa.
During all this interval, the Syracusan harbor had been watched
by a Carthaginian fleet, obstructing the entry of provisions,
and causing partial scarcity.<a id="FNanchor_1020"
href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> But there
was no blockading army on land; nor had the dominion of Agathokles,
upheld as it was by his brother Antander and his mercenary force,
been at all shaken. His arrival inspired his partisans and soldiers
with new courage, while it spread terror throughout most parts of
Sicily. To contend with the Carthaginian blockading squadron, he
made efforts to procure maritime aid from the Tyrrhenian ports
in Italy;<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021"
class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> while on land, his forces were now
preponderant—owing to the recent defeat, and broken spirit, of
the Agrigentines. But his prospects were suddenly checked by the
enterprising move of his old enemy—the Syracusan exile Deinokrates;
who made profession of taking up that generous policy which the
Agrigentines had tacitly let fall—announcing himself as the champion
of autonomous city-government, and equal confederacy, throughout
Sicily. Deinokrates received ready adhesion from most of the cities
belonging to the Agrigentine confederacy—all of them who were alarmed
by finding that the weakness or fears of their presiding city had
left them unprotected against Agathokles. He was soon at the head
of a powerful army—20,000 foot, and 1500 horse. Moreover a large
proportion of his army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[p.
441]</span> were not citizen militia, but practised soldiers; for
the most part exiles, driven from their homes by the distractions
and violences of the Agathoklean æra.<a id="FNanchor_1022"
href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> For military
purposes, both he and his soldiers were far more strenuous and
effective than the Agrigentines under Xenodokus had been. He not only
kept the field against Agathokles, but several times offered him
battle, which the despot did not feel confidence enough to accept.
Agathokles could do no more than maintain himself in Syracuse, while
the Sicilian cities generally were put in security against his
aggressions.</p>

<p>Amidst this unprosperous course of affairs in Sicily, Agathokles
received messengers from his son, reporting the defeats in Africa.
Preparing immediately to revisit that country, he was fortunate
enough to obtain a reinforcement of Tyrrhenian ships of war, which
enabled him to overcome the Carthaginian blockading squadron at
the mouth of the Syracusan harbor. A clear passage to Africa
was thus secured for himself, together with ample supplies of
imported provisions for the Syracusans.<a id="FNanchor_1023"
href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Though
still unable to combat Deinokrates in the field, Agathokles was
emboldened by his recent naval victory to send forth Leptines with
a force to invade the Agrigentines—the jealous rivals, rather than
the allies, of Deinokrates. The Agrigentine army—under the general
Xenodokus, whom Leptines had before defeated—consisted of citizen
militia mustered on the occasion; while the Agathoklean mercenaries,
conducted by Leptines, had made arms a profession, and were used
to fighting as well as to hardships.<a id="FNanchor_1024"
href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> Here as
elsewhere in Greece, we find the civic and patriotic energy trampled
down by professional soldiership, and reduced to operate only as an
obsequious instrument for administrative details.</p>

<p>Xenodokus, conscious of the inferiority of his Agrigentine force,
was reluctant to hazard a battle. Driven to this imprudence by the
taunts of his soldiers, he was defeated a second time by Leptines,
and became so apprehensive of the wrath of the Agrigentines, that
he thought it expedient to retire to Gela.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_442">[p. 442]</span> After a period of rejoicing, for his
recent victories by land as well as by sea, Agathokles passed over
to Africa, where he found his son, with the army at Tunês in great
despondency and privation, and almost mutiny for want of pay. They
still amounted to 6000 Grecian mercenaries, 6000 Gauls, Samnites,
and Tyrrhenians—1500 cavalry—and no less than 6000 (if the number
be correct) Libyan war-chariots. There were also a numerous body
of Libyan allies; faithless time-servers, watching for the turn of
fortune. The Carthaginians, occupying strong camps in the vicinity
of Tunês, and abundantly supplied, awaited patiently the destroying
effects of privation and suffering on their enemies. So desperate
was the position of Agathokles, that he was compelled to go forth
and fight. Having tried in vain to draw the Carthaginians down
into the plain, he at length attacked them in the full strength of
their entrenchments. But in spite of the most strenuous efforts,
his troops were repulsed with great slaughter, and driven back to
their camp.<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025"
class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

<p>The night succeeding this battle was a scene of disorder and
panic in both camps; even in that of the victorious Carthaginians.
The latter, according to the ordinances of their religion, eager to
return their heartfelt thanks to the gods for this great victory,
sacrificed to them as a choice offering the handsomest prisoners
captured.<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026"
class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> During this process, the tent or
tabernacle consecrated to the gods, close to the altar as well as to
the general’s tent, accidentally took fire. The tents being formed by
mere wooden posts, connected by a thatch of hay or straw both on roof
and sides,—the fire spread rapidly, and the entire camp was burnt,
together with many soldiers who tried to arrest the conflagration.
So distracting was the terror occasioned by this catastrophe, that
the whole Carthaginian army for the time dispersed; and Agathokles,
had he been prepared, might have destroyed them. But it happened that
at the same hour, his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[p.
443]</span> camp was thrown into utter confusion by a different
accident, rendering his soldiers incapable of being brought into
action.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027"
class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>His position at Tunês had now become desperate. His Libyan allies
had all declared against him, after the recent defeat. He could
neither continue to hold Tunês, nor carry away his troops to Sicily;
for he had but few vessels, and the Carthaginians were masters at
sea. Seeing no resource, he resolved to embark secretly with his
younger son Herakleides; abandoning Archagathus and the army to their
fate. But Archagathus and the other officers, suspecting his purpose,
were thoroughly resolved that the man who had brought them into
destruction should not thus slip away and betray them. As Agathokles
was on the point of going aboard at night, he found himself watched,
arrested, and held prisoner, by the indignant soldiery. The whole
town now became a scene of disorder and tumult, aggravated by the
rumor that the enemy were marching up to attack them. Amidst the
general alarm, the guards who had been set over Agathokles, thinking
his services indispensable for defence, brought him out with his
fetters still on. When the soldiers saw him in this condition,
their sentiment towards him again reverted to pity and admiration,
notwithstanding his projected desertion; moreover they hoped for his
guidance to resist the impending attack. With one voice they called
upon the guards to strike off his chains and set him free. Agathokles
was again at liberty. But insensible to everything except his own
personal safety, he presently stole away, leaped unperceived into a
skiff, with a few attendants, but without either of his sons,—and was
lucky enough to arrive, in spite of stormy November weather, on the
coast of Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028"
class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>So terrible was the fury of the soldiers, on discovering that
Agathokles had accomplished his desertion, that they slew both
his sons, Archagathus and Herakleides. No resource was left but
to elect new generals, and make the best terms they could<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[p. 444]</span> with Carthage. They
were still a formidable body, retaining in their hands various
other towns besides Tunês; so that the Carthaginians, relieved
from all fear of Agathokles, thought it prudent to grant an easy
capitulation. It was agreed that all the towns should be restored
to the Carthaginians, on payment of 300 talents; that such soldiers
as chose to enter into the African service of Carthage, should
be received on full pay; but that such as preferred returning to
Sicily should be transported thither, with permission to reside in
the Carthaginian town of Solus (or Soluntum). On these terms the
convention was concluded, and the army finally broken up. Some indeed
among the Grecian garrisons, quartered in the outlying posts, being
rash enough to dissent and hold out, were besieged and taken by the
Carthaginian force. Their commanders were crucified, and the soldiers
condemned to rural work as fettered slaves.<a id="FNanchor_1029"
href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p>Thus miserably terminated the expedition of Agathokles to
Africa, after an interval of four years from the time of his
landing. By the <i>vana mirantes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1030"
href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> who looked out
for curious coincidences (probably Timæus), it was remarked, that
his ultimate flight, with the slaughter of his two sons, occurred
exactly on the same day of the year following his assassination
of Ophellas.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031"
class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> Ancient writers extol, with good
reason, the bold and striking conception of transferring the war
to Africa, at the very moment when he was himself besieged in
Syracuse by a superior Carthaginian force. But while admitting
the military resource, skill, and energy, of Agathokles, we must
not forget that his success in Africa was materially furthered by
the treasonable conduct of the Carthaginian general Bomilkar—an
accidental coincidence in point of time. Nor is it to be overlooked,
that Agathokles missed the opportunity of turning his first success
to account, at a moment when the Carthaginians would probably have
purchased his evacuation of Africa by making large concessions to
him in Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032"
class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> He imprudently persisted in the war,
though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[p. 445]</span> the
complete conquest of Carthage was beyond his strength—and though
it was still more beyond his strength to prosecute effective war,
simultaneously and for a long time, in Sicily and in Africa. The
African subjects of Carthage were not attached to her; but neither
were they attached to him;—nor, on the long run, did they do him any
serious good. Agathokles is a man of force and fraud—consummate in
the use of both. His whole life is a series of successful adventures,
and strokes of bold ingenuity to extricate himself from difficulties;
but there is wanting in him all predetermined general plan, or
measured range of ambition, to which these single exploits might be
made subservient.</p>

<p>After his passage from Africa, Agathokles landed on the western
corner of Sicily near the town of Egesta, which was then in alliance
with him. He sent to Syracuse for a reinforcement. But he was
hard pressed for money; he suspected, or pretended to suspect,
the Egestæans of disaffection; accordingly, on receiving his new
force, he employed it to commit revolting massacre and plunder in
Egesta. The town is reported to have contained 10,000 citizens.
Of these Agathokles caused the poorer men to be for the most part
murdered; the richer were cruelly tortured, and even their wives
tortured and mutilated, to compel revelations of concealed wealth;
the children of both sexes were transported to Italy, and there
sold as slaves to the Bruttians. The original population being
thus nearly extirpated, Agathokles changed the name of the town to
Dikæopolis, assigning it as a residence to such deserters as might
join him.<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033"
class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> This atrocity, more suitable to
Africa<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034"
class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> than Greece (where the mutilation
of women is almost unheard of), was probably the way in which
his savage pride obtained some kind of retaliatory satisfaction
for the recent calamity and humiliation in Africa. Under the
like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[p. 446]</span> sentiment,
he perpetrated another deed of blood at Syracuse. Having learnt
that the soldiers, whom he had deserted at Tunês, had after his
departure put to death his two sons, he gave orders to Antander
his brother (viceroy of Syracuse), to massacre all the relatives
of those Syracusans who had served him in the African expedition.
This order was fulfilled by Antander (we are assured) accurately
and to the letter. Neither age or sex—grandsire or infant—wife or
mother—were spared by the Agathoklean executioners. We may be sure
that their properties were plundered at the same time; we hear of no
mutilations.<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035"
class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>

<p>Still Agathokles tried to maintain his hold on the Sicilian towns
which remained to him; but his cruelties as well as his reverses
had produced a strong sentiment against him, and even his general
Pasiphilus revolted to join Deinokrates. That exile was now at the
head of an army stated at 20,000 men, the most formidable military
force in Sicily; so that Agathokles, feeling the inadequacy of his
own means, sent to solicit peace, and to offer tempting conditions.
He announced his readiness to evacuate Syracuse altogether, and
to be content, if two maritime towns on the northern coast of the
island—Therma and Kephaloidion—were assigned to his mercenaries and
himself. Under this proposition, Deinokrates, and the other Syracusan
exiles, had the opportunity of entering Syracuse, and reconstituting
the free city-government. Had Deinokrates been another Timoleon, the
city might now have acquired and enjoyed another temporary sunshine
of autonomy and prosperity; but his ambition was thoroughly selfish.
As commander of this large army, he enjoyed a station of power and
license such as he was not likely to obtain under the reconstituted
city-government of Syracuse. He therefore evaded the propositions of
Agathokles, requiring still larger concessions; until at length the
Syracusan exiles in his own army (partly instigated by emissaries
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[p. 447]</span> Agathokles
himself) began to suspect his selfish projects, and to waver in
their fidelity to him. Meanwhile Agathokles, being repudiated by
Deinokrates, addressed himself to the Carthaginians, and concluded
a treaty with them, restoring or guaranteeing to them all the
possessions that they had ever enjoyed in Sicily. In return for
this concession, he received from them a sum of money, and a large
supply of corn.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036"
class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></p>

<p>Relieved from Carthaginian hostility, Agathokles presently
ventured to march against the army of Deinokrates. The latter was
indeed greatly superior in strength, but many of his soldiers
were now lukewarm or disaffected, and Agathokles had established
among them correspondences upon which he could rely. At a great
battle fought near Torgium, many of them went over on the field to
Agathokles, giving to him a complete victory. The army of Deinokrates
was completely dispersed. Shortly afterwards a considerable body
among them (4000 men, or 7000 men, according to different statements)
surrendered to the victor on terms. As soon as they had delivered up
their arms, Agathokles, regardless of his covenant, caused them to be
surrounded by his own army, and massacred.<a id="FNanchor_1037"
href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a></p>

<p>It appears as if the recent victory had been the result of a
secret and treacherous compact between Agathokles and Deinokrates;
and as if the prisoners massacred by Agathokles were those of
whom Deinokrates wished to rid himself as malcontents; for
immediately after the battle, a reconciliation took place between
the two. Agathokles admitted the other as a sort of partner in his
despotism; while Deinokrates not only brought into the partnership
all the military means and strong posts which he had been two
years in acquiring, but also betrayed to Agathokles the revolted
general Pasiphilus with the town of Gela occupied by the latter.
It is noticed as singular, that Agathokles, generally faithless
and unscrupulous towards both friends and enemies, kept up the
best understanding and confidence with Deinokrates to the end of
his life.<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038"
class="fnanchor">[1038]</a></p>

<p>The despot had now regained full power at Syracuse, together<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[p. 448]</span> with a great extent
of dominion in Sicily. The remainder of his restless existence
was spent in operations of hostility or plunder against more
northerly enemies—the Liparæan isles<a id="FNanchor_1039"
href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a>—the Italian
cities and the Bruttians—the island of Korkyra. We are unable to
follow his proceedings in detail. He was threatened with a formidable
attack<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040"
class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> by the Spartan prince Kleonymus, who
was invited by the Tarentines to aid them against the Lucanians
and Romans. But Kleonymus found enough to occupy him elsewhere,
without visiting Sicily. He collected a considerable force on the
coast of Italy, undertook operations with success against the
Lucanians, and even captured the town of Thurii. But the Romans,
now pushing their intervention even to the Tarentine Gulf, drove
him off and retook the town; moreover his own behavior was so
tyrannical and profligate, as to draw upon him universal hatred.
Returning from Italy to Korkyra, Kleonymus made himself master of
that important island, intending to employ it as a base of operations
both against Greece and against Italy.<a id="FNanchor_1041"
href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> He failed
however in various expeditions both in the Tarentine Gulf and
the Adriatic. Demetrius Poliorketes and Kassander alike tried to
conclude an alliance with him; but in vain.<a id="FNanchor_1042"
href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> At a
subsequent period, Korkyra was besieged by Kassander with a large
naval and military force; Kleonymus then retired (or perhaps had
previously retired) to Sparta. Kassander, having reduced the island
to great straits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[p. 449]</span>
was on the point of taking it, when it was relieved by Agathokles
with a powerful armament. That despot was engaged in operations on
the coast of Italy against the Bruttians when his aid to Korkyra
was solicited; he destroyed most part of the Macedonian fleet,
and then seized the island for himself.<a id="FNanchor_1043"
href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> On returning
from this victorious expedition to the Italian coast, where he
had left a detachment of his Ligurian and Tuscan mercenaries, he
was informed that these mercenaries had been turbulent during
his absence, in demanding the pay due to them from his grandson
Archagathus. He caused them all to be slain, to the number of
2000.<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044"
class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>

<p>As far as we can trace the events of the last years of
Agathokles, we find him seizing the towns of Kroton and
Hipponia in Italy, establishing an alliance with Demetrius
Poliorketes,<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045"
class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> and giving his daughter Lanassa in
marriage to the youthful Pyrrhus king of Epirus. At the age of
seventy-two, still in the plenitude of vigor as well as of power,
he was projecting a fresh expedition against the Carthaginians in
Africa, with two hundred of the largest ships of war, when his career
was brought to a close by sickness and by domestic enemies.</p>

<p>He proclaimed as future successor to his dominion, his son, named
Agathokles; but Archagathus his grandson (son of Archagathus who had
perished in Africa), a young prince of more conspicuous qualities,
had already been singled out for the most important command, and was
now at the head of the army near Ætna. The old Agathokles, wishing to
strengthen the hands of his intended successor, sent his favored son
Agathokles to Ætna, with written orders directing that Archagathus
should yield up to him the command. Archagathus, noway disposed to
obey, invited his uncle Agathokles to a banquet, and killed him;
after which he contrived the poisoning of his grandfather the old
despot himself. The instrument of his purpose was Mænon; a citizen
of Egesta, enslaved at the time when Agathokles massacred most of
the Egestæan population. The beauty of his person procured him much
favor with Agathokles; but he had never for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_450">[p. 450]</span>gotten, and had always been anxious to
avenge, the bloody outrage on his fellow-citizens. To accomplish
this purpose, the opportunity was now opened to him, together with a
promise of protection, through Archagathus. He accordingly poisoned
Agathokles, as we are told, by means of a medicated quill, handed to
him for cleaning his teeth after dinner.<a id="FNanchor_1046"
href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> Combining
together the various accounts, it seems probable that Agathokles
was at the time sick—that this sickness may have been the reason
why he was so anxious to strengthen the position of his intended
successor—and that his death was as much the effect of his malady
as of the poison. Archagathus, after murdering his uncle, seems by
means of his army to have made himself real master of the Syracusan
power; while the old despot, defenceless on a sick bed, could do
no more than provide for the safety of his Egyptian wife Theoxena
and his two young children, by despatching them on shipboard with
all his rich movable treasures to Alexandria. Having secured
this object, amidst extreme grief on the part of those around,
he expired.<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047"
class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>The great lines in the character of Agathokles are well marked.
He was of the stamp of Gelon and the elder Dionysius—a soldier of
fortune, who raised himself from the meanest beginnings to the summit
of political power—and who, in the acquisition as well as maintenance
of that power, displayed an extent of energy, perseverance, and
military resource, not surpassed by any one, even of the generals
formed in Alexander’s school. He was an adept in that art at which
all aspiring men of his age aimed—the handling of mercenary soldiers
for the extinction of political liberty and security at home, and
for predatory aggrandizement abroad. I have already noticed the
opinion delivered by Scipio Africanus—that the elder Dionysius and
Agathokles were the most daring, sagacious, and capable men of
action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[p. 451]</span> within
his knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048"
class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> Apart from this enterprising genius,
employed in the service of unmeasured personal ambition, we
know nothing of Agathokles except his sanguinary, faithless,
and nefarious dispositions; in which attributes also he stands
pre-eminent, above all his known contemporaries, and above nearly all
predecessors.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049"
class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Notwithstanding his often-proved
perfidy, he seems to have had a joviality and apparent simplicity
of manner (the same is recounted of Cæsar Borgia) which amused
men and put them off their guard, throwing them perpetually into
his trap.<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050"
class="fnanchor">[1050]</a></p>

<p>Agathokles, however, though among the worst of Greeks, was yet
a Greek. During his government of thirty-two years, the course
of events in Sicily continued under Hellenic agency, without the
preponderant intervention of any foreign power. The power of
Agathokles indeed rested mainly on foreign mercenaries; but so
had that of Dionysius and Gelon before him;<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_452">[p. 452]</span> and he as well as they, kept up
vigorously the old conflict against the Carthaginian power in
the island. Grecian history in Sicily thus continues down to the
death of Agathokles; but it continues no longer. After his death,
Hellenic power and interests become incapable of self-support,
and sink into a secondary and subservient position, overridden or
contended for by foreigners. Syracuse and the other cities passed
from one despot to another, and were torn with discord arising
out of the crowds of foreign mercenaries who had obtained footing
among them. At the same time, the Carthaginians made increased
efforts to push their conquests in the island, without finding
any sufficient internal resistance; so that they would have taken
Syracuse, and made Sicily their own, had not Pyrrhus king of Epirus
(the son-in-law of Agathokles) interposed to arrest their progress.
From this time forward, the Greeks of Sicily become a prize to be
contended for—first between the Carthaginians and Pyrrhus—next,
between the Carthaginians and Romans<a id="FNanchor_1051"
href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a>—until at
length they dwindle into subjects of Rome; corn-growers for the Roman
plebs, clients under the patronage of the Roman Marcelli, victims of
the rapacity of Verres, and suppliants for the tutelary eloquence of
Cicero. The historian of self-acting Hellas loses sight of them at
the death of Agathokles.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> complete the picture of the
Hellenic world while yet in its period of full life, in freedom
and self-action, or even during its decline into the half-life
of a dependent condition—we must say a few words respecting some
of its members lying apart from the general history, yet of not
inconsiderable importance. The Greeks of Massalia formed its western
wing; the Pontic Greeks (those on the shores of the Euxine), its
eastern; both of them the outermost radiations of Hellenism, where it
was always militant against foreign elements, and often adulterated
by them. It is indeed little that we have the means of saying; but
that little must not be left unsaid.</p>

<p>In my third volume (ch. xxii. p. 397), I briefly noticed the
foundation and first proceedings of Massalia (the modern Marseilles),
on the Mediterranean coast of Gaul or Liguria. This Ionic city,
founded by the enterprising Phokæans of Asia Minor, a little before
their own seaboard was subjugated by the Persians, had a life and
career of its own, apart from those political events which determined
the condition of its Hellenic sisters in Asia, Peloponnesus, Italy,
or Sicily. The Massaliots maintained their own relations of commerce,
friendship or hostility with their barbaric neighbors, the Ligurians,
Gauls, and Iberians, without becoming involved in the larger
political confederacies of the Hellenic world. They carried out from
their mother-city established habits of adventurous coast navigation
and commercial activity. Their situation, distant from other Greeks
and sustained by a force hardly sufficient even for defence,
imposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[p. 454]</span> upon them
the necessity both of political harmony at home, and of prudence and
persuasive agency in their mode of dealing with neighbors. That they
were found equal to this necessity, appears sufficiently attested by
the few general statements transmitted in respect to them; though
their history in its details is unknown. Their city was strong by
position, situated upon a promontory washed on three sides by the
sea, well-fortified, and possessing a convenient harbor securely
closed against enemies.<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052"
class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> The domain around it however appears
not to have been large, nor did their population extend itself much
into the interior. The land around was less adapted for corn than
for the vine and the olive; wine was supplied by the Massaliots
throughout Gaul.<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053"
class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> It was on shipboard that their courage
and skill was chiefly displayed; it was by maritime enterprise that
their power, their wealth, and their colonial expansion was obtained.
In an age when piracy was common, the Massaliot ships and seamen
were effective in attack and defence not less than in transport and
commercial interchange; while their numerous maritime successes were
attested by many trophies adorning the temples.<a id="FNanchor_1054"
href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> The city contained
docks and arsenals admirably provided with provisions, stores, arms,
and all the various muniments of naval war.<a id="FNanchor_1055"
href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> Except the
Phenicians and Carthaginians, these Massaliots were the only
enterprising mariners in the Western Mediterranean; from the year 500
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> downward, after the energy of the Ionic
Greeks had been crushed by inland potentates. The Iberian and Gallic
tribes were essentially landsmen, not occupying permanent stations on
the coast, nor having any vocation for the sea; but the Ligurians,
though chiefly mountaineers, were annoying neighbors to Massalia as
well by their piracies at sea as from their depredations by land.<a
id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a>
To all these landsmen, however, depredators as they were, the visit
of the trader soon made itself felt as a want, both for import<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[p. 455]</span> and export; and
to this want the Massaliots, with their colonies, were the only
ministers, along the Gulfs of Genoa and Lyons, from Luna (the
frontier of Tuscany) to the Dianium (Cape della Nao) in Spain.<a
id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>
It was not until the first century before the Christian era that they
were outstripped in this career by Narbon, and a few other neighbors,
exalted into Roman colonies.</p>

<p>Along the coast on both sides of their own city, the Massaliots
planted colonies, each commended to the protection, and consecrated
by the statue and peculiar rites, of their own patron goddess,
the Ephesian Artemis.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058"
class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> Towards the east were Tauroentium,
Olbia, Antipolis, Nikæa, and the Portus Monœki; towards the west,
on the coast of Spain, were Rhoda, Emporiæ, Alônê, Hemeroskopium,
and Artemisium or Dianium. These colonies were established chiefly
on outlying capes or sometimes islets, at once near and safe; they
were intended more as shelter and accommodation for maritime traffic,
and as depots for trade with the interior,—than for the purpose of
spreading inland, and including a numerous outlying population round
the walls. The circumstances of Emporiæ were the most remarkable.
That town was built originally on a little uninhabited islet off the
coast of Iberia; after a certain interval, it became extended to the
adjoining mainland, and a body of native Iberians were admitted to
joint residence within the new-walled circuit there established. This
new circuit however was divided in half by an intervening wall, on
one side of which dwelt the Iberians, on the other side the Greeks.
One gate alone was permitted, for intercommunication, guarded night
and day by appointed magistrates, one of whom was perpetually on
the spot. Every night, one third of the Greek citizens kept guard
on the walls, or at least held themselves prepared to do so. How
long these strict and fatiguing precautions were found necessary,
we do not know; but after a certain time they were relaxed, and
the intervening wall disappeared, so that Greeks and Iberians
freely coalesced into one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[p.
456]</span> community.<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059"
class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> It is not often that we are allowed
to see so much in detail the early difficulties and dangers of a
Grecian colony. Massalia itself was situated under nearly similar
circumstances among the rude Ligurian Salyes; we hear of these
Ligurians hiring themselves as laborers to dig on the fields of
Massaliot proprietors.<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060"
class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> The various tribes of Ligurians,
Gauls, and Iberians extended down to the coast, so that there was
no safe road along it, nor any communication except by sea, until
the conquests of the Romans in the second and first century before
the Christian era.<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061"
class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

<p>The government of Massalia was oligarchical, carried on chiefly by
a Senate or Great Council of Six Hundred (called Timuchi), elected
for life—and by a small council of fifteen, chosen among this
larger body to take turn in executive duties.<a id="FNanchor_1062"
href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> The public
habits of the administrators are said to have been extremely
vigilant and circumspect; the private habits of the citizens,
frugal and temperate—a maximum being fixed by law for dowries and
marriage-ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063"
class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> They were careful in their dealings
with the native tribes, with whom they appear to have maintained
relations generally friendly. The historian Ephorus (whose
history closed about 340 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) represented
the Gauls as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[p. 457]</span>
especially phil-hellenic;<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064"
class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> an impression which he could hardly
have derived from any but Massaliot informants. The Massaliots (who
in the first century before Christ were <i>trilingues</i>, speaking
Greek, Latin, and Gallic<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065"
class="fnanchor">[1065]</a>) contributed to engraft upon these
unlettered men a certain refinement and variety of wants, and to lay
the foundation of that taste for letters which afterwards became
largely diffused throughout the Roman Province of Gaul. At sea, and
in traffic, the Phenicians and Carthaginians were their formidable
rivals. This was among the causes which threw them betimes into
alliance and active co-operation with Rome, under whose rule they
obtained favorable treatment, when the blessing of freedom was no
longer within their reach.</p>

<p>Enough is known about Massalia to show that the city was a
genuine specimen of Hellenism and Hellenic influences—acting not
by force or constraint, but simply by superior intelligence and
activity—by power of ministering to wants which must otherwise have
remained unsupplied—and by the assimilating effect of a lettered
civilization upon ruder neighbors. This is the more to be noticed
as it contrasts strikingly with the Macedonian influences which
have occupied so much of the present volume; force admirably
organized and wielded by Alexander, yet still nothing but force.
The loss of all details respecting the history of Massalia is
greatly to be lamented; and hardly less, that of the writings of
Pytheas, an intelligent Massaliotic navigator, who, at this early
age (330-320 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),<a id="FNanchor_1066"
href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> with an
adventurous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[p. 458]</span>
boldness even more than Phokæan, sailed through the Pillars of
Herakles and from thence northward along the coast of Spain, Gaul,
Britain, Germany—perhaps yet farther. Probably no Greek except a
Massaliot could have accomplished such a voyage; which in his case
deserves the greater sympathy, as there was no other reward for the
difficulties and dangers braved, except the gratification of an
intelligent curiosity. It seems plain that the publication of his
“Survey of the Earth”—much consulted by Eratosthenes, though the
criticisms which have reached us through Polybius and Strabo dwell
chiefly upon its mistakes, real or supposed—made an epoch in ancient
geographical knowledge.</p>

<p>From the western wing of the Hellenic world, we pass to the
eastern—the Euxine Sea. Of the Pentapolis on its western coast
south of the Danube (Apollonia, Mesembria, Kallatis, Odessus, and
probably Istrus)—and of Tyras near the mouth of the river so called
(now Dniester)—we have little to record, though Istrus and Apollonia
were among the towns whose political constitutions Aristotle thought
worthy of his examination.<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067"
class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> But Herakleia on the south coast, and
Pantikapæum or Bosporus between the Euxine and the Palus Mæotis (now
Sea of Azof), are not thus unknown to history; nor can Sinôpê (on the
south coast) and Olbia (on the north-west) be altogether passed over.
Though lying apart from the political headship of Athens or Sparta,
all these cities were legitimate members of the Hellenic brotherhood.
All supplied spectators and competitors for the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_459">[p. 459]</span> Pan-hellenic festivals—pupils to the
rhetors and philosophers—purchasers, and sometimes even rivals, to
the artists. All too were (like Massalia and Kyrênê) adulterated
partially—Olbia and Bosporus considerably—by admixture of a
non-hellenic element.</p>

<p>Of Sinôpê, and its three dependent colonies Kotyôra, Kerasus,
and Trapezus, I have already said something,<a id="FNanchor_1068"
href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> in describing
the retreat of the Ten Thousand Greeks. Like Massalia with its
dependencies Antipolis, Nikæa, and others—Sinôpê enjoyed not merely
practical independence, but considerable prosperity and local
dignity, at the time when Xenophon and his companions marched through
those regions. The citizens were on terms of equal alliance, mutually
advantageous, with Korylas prince of Paphlagonia, on the borders
of whose territory they dwelt. It is probable that they figured on
the tribute list of the Persian king as a portion of Paphlagonia,
and paid an annual sum; but here ended their subjection. Their
behavior towards the Ten Thousand Greeks, pronounced enemies of the
Persian king, was that of an independent city. Neither they, nor
even the inland Paphlagonians, warlike and turbulent, were molested
with Persian governors or military occupation.<a id="FNanchor_1069"
href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> Alexander however
numbered them among the subjects of Persia; and it is a remarkable
fact, that envoys from Sinôpê were found remaining with Darius almost
to his last hour, after he had become a conquered fugitive, and had
lost his armies, his capitals, and his treasures. These Sinopian
envoys fell into the hands of Alexander; who set them at liberty
with the remark, that since they were not members of the Hellenic
confederacy, but subjects of Persia—their presence as envoys near
Darius was very excusable.<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070"
class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> The position of Sinôpê placed her out
of the direct range of the hostilities carried on by Alexander’s
successors against each other; and the ancient Kappadokian princes
of the Mithridatic family (professedly descendants of the Persian
Achæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[p. 460]</span>menidæ),<a
id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a>
who ultimately ripened into the king of Pontus, had not become
sufficiently powerful to swallow up her independence until the reign
of Pharnakes, in the second century before Christ. Sinôpê then
passed under his dominion; exchanging (like others) the condition of
a free Grecian city for that of a subject of the barbaric kings of
Pontus, with a citadel and mercenary garrison to keep her citizens in
obedience. We know nothing however of the intermediate events.</p>

<p>Respecting the Pontic Herakleia, our ignorance is not so complete.
That city—much nearer than Sinôpê to the mouth of the Thracian
Bosporus, and distant by sea from Byzantium only one long day’s
voyage of a rowboat—was established by Megarians and Bœotians
on the coast of the Mariandyni. These natives were subdued, and
reduced to a kind of serfdom; whereby they became slaves, yet with
a proviso that they should never be sold out of the territory.
Adjoining, on the westward, between Herakleia and Byzantium, were
the Bithynian Thracians—villagers not merely independent, but
warlike and fierce wreckers, who cruelly maltreated any Greeks
stranded on their coast.<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072"
class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> We are told in general terms that the
government of Herakleia was oligarchical;<a id="FNanchor_1073"
href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> perhaps in the
hands of the descendants of the principal original colonists, who
partitioned among themselves the territory with its Mariandynian
serfs, and who formed a small but rich minority among the total
population. We hear of them as powerful at sea, and as being
able to man, through their numerous serfs, a considerable fleet,
with which they invaded the territory of Leukon prince of the
Kimmerian Bosporus.<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074"
class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> They were also engaged in land-war with
Mithridates,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[p. 461]</span> a
prince of the ancient Persian family established as district rulers
in Northern Kappadokia.<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075"
class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<p>Towards 380-370 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the Herakleots became
disturbed by violent party-contentions within the city. As far as we
can divine from a few obscure hints, these contentions began among
the oligarchy themselves;<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076"
class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> some of whom opposed, and partially
threw open, a close political monopoly—yet not without a struggle,
in the course of which an energetic citizen named Klearchus was
banished. Presently however the contest assumed larger dimensions;
the plebs sought admission into the constitution, and are even said
to have required abolition of debts with a redivision of the lands.<a
id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a>
A democratical constitution was established; but it was speedily
menaced by conspiracies of the rich, to guard against which, the
classification of the citizens was altered. Instead of three tribes,
and four centuries, all were distributed anew into sixty-four
centuries; the tribes being discontinued. It would appear that in the
original four centuries, the rich men had been so enrolled as to form
separate military divisions (probably their rustic serfs being armed
along with them)—-while the three tribes had contained all the rest
of the people; so that the effect of thus multiplying the centuries
was, to divest the rich of their separate military enrolment,
and to disseminate them in many different regiments along with a
greater number of poor.<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078"
class="fnanchor">[1078]</a></p>

<p>Still however the demands of the people were not fully granted,
and dissension continued. Not merely the poorer citizens, but also
the population of serfs—homogeneous, speaking the same language, and
sympathizing with each other, like Helots or<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_462">[p. 462]</span> Penestæ—when once agitated by the hope
of liberty, were with difficulty appeased. The government, though
greatly democratized, found itself unable to maintain tranquillity,
and invoked assistance from without. Application was made first,
to the Athenian Timotheus—next, to the Theban Epaminondas; but
neither of them would interfere—nor was there, indeed, any motive
to tempt them. At length application was made to the exiled citizen
Klearchus.</p>

<p>This exile, now about forty years of age, intelligent, audacious
and unprincipled, had passed four years at Athens partly in
hearing the lessons of Plato and Isokrates—and had watched with
emulous curiosity the brilliant fortune of the despot Dionysius
at Syracuse, in whom both these philosophers took interest.<a
id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>
During his banishment, moreover, he had done what was common with
Grecian exiles; he had taken service with the enemy of his native
city, the neighboring prince Mithridates,<a id="FNanchor_1080"
href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> and probably
enough against the city itself. As an officer, he distinguished
himself much; acquiring renown with the prince and influence<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[p. 463]</span> over the minds of
soldiers. Hence his friends, and a party in Herakleia, became
anxious to recall him, as moderator and protector under the
grievous political discords prevailing. It was the oligarchical
party who invited him to come back, at the head of a body of
troops, as their auxiliary in keeping down the plebs. Klearchus
accepted their invitation; but with the full purpose of making
himself the Dionysius of Herakleia. Obtaining from Mithridates a
powerful body of mercenaries, under secret promise to hold the
city only as his prefect, he marched thither with the proclaimed
purpose of maintaining order, and upholding the government. As
his mercenary soldiers were soon found troublesome companions,
he obtained permission to construct a separate stronghold in
the city, under color of keeping them apart in the stricter
discipline of a barrack.<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081"
class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> Having thus secured a strong position,
he invited Mithridates into the city, to receive the promised
possession; but instead of performing this engagement, he detained
the prince as prisoner, and only released him on payment of a
considerable ransom. He next cheated, still more grossly, the
oligarchy who had recalled him; denouncing their past misrule,
declaring himself their mortal enemy, and espousing the pretensions
as well as the antipathies of the plebs. The latter willingly
seconded him in his measures—even extreme measures of cruelty and
spoliation—against their political enemies. A large number of
the rich were killed, imprisoned, or impoverished and banished;
their slaves or serfs, too, were not only manumitted by order of
the new despot, but also married to the wives and daughters of
the exiles. The most tragical scenes arose out of these forced
marriages; many of the women even killed themselves, some after
having first killed their new husbands. Among the exiles, a party,
driven to despair, procured assistance from without, and tried to
obtain by force readmittance into the city; but they were totally
defeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[p. 464]</span>
by Klearchus, who after this victory became more brutal and
unrelenting than ever.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082"
class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>He was now in irresistible power; despot of the whole city, plebs
as well as oligarchy. Such he continued to be for twelve years;
during which he displayed great warlike energy against exterior
enemies, together with unabated cruelty towards the citizens. He
farther indulged in the most overweening insolence of personal
demeanor, adopting an Oriental costume and ornaments, and proclaiming
himself the son of Zeus—as Alexander the Great did after him. Amidst
all these enormities, however, his literary tastes did not forsake
him; he collected a library, at that time a very rare possession.<a
id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a>
Many were the conspiracies attempted by suffering citizens against
this tyrant; but his vigilance baffled and punished all. At length
two young men, Chion and Leonidas (they too having been among the
hearers of Plato), found an opportunity to stab him at a Dionysiac
festival. They, with those who seconded them, were slain by his
guards, after a gallant resistance; but Klearchus himself died of
the wound, in torture and mental remorse.<a id="FNanchor_1084"
href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a></p>

<p>His death unfortunately brought no relief to the Herakleots. The
two sons whom he left, Timotheus and Dionysius, were both minors; but
his brother Satyrus, administering in their name, grasped the sceptre
and continued the despotism, with cruelty not merely undiminished,
but even aggravated and sharpened by the past assassination. Not
inferior to his predecessor in energy and vigilance, Satyrus was in
this respect different, that he was altogether rude and unlettered.
Moreover he was rigidly scrupulous in preserving the crown for his
brother’s children, as soon as they should be of age. To ensure to
them an undisturbed succession, he took every precaution to avoid
begetting children of his own by his wife.<a id="FNanchor_1085"
href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> After a rule of
seven years, Satyrus died of a lingering and painful distemper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[p. 465]</span>The government
of Herakleia now devolved on Timotheus, who exhibited a contrast,
alike marked and beneficent, with his father and uncle. Renouncing
all their cruelty and constraint, he set at liberty every man whom he
found in prison. He was strict in dispensing justice, but mild and
even liberal in all his dealings towards the citizens. At the same
time, he was a man of adventurous courage, carrying on successful
war against foreign enemies, and making his power respected all
round. With his younger brother Dionysius, he maintained perfect
harmony, treating him as an equal and partner. Though thus using
his power generously towards the Herakleots, he was, however, still
a despot, and retained the characteristic marks of despotism—the
strong citadel, fortified separately from the town, with a commanding
mercenary force. After a reign of about nine years, he died, deeply
mourned by every one.<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086"
class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

<p>Dionysius, who succeeded him, fell upon unsettled times, full
both of hope and fear; opening chances of aggrandizement, yet
with many new dangers and uncertainties. The sovereignty which he
inherited doubtless included, not simply the city of Herakleia,
but also foreign dependencies and possessions in its<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[p. 466]</span> neighborhood; for
his three predecessors<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087"
class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> had been all enterprising chiefs,
commanding a considerable aggressive force. At the commencement of
his reign, indeed, the ascendency of Memnon and the Persian force
in the north-western part of Asia Minor was at a higher pitch
than ordinary; it appears too that Klearchus—and probably his
successors also—had always taken care to keep on the best terms
with the Persian court.<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088"
class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> But presently came the invasion of
Alexander (334 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), with the battle of the
Granikus, which totally extinguished the Persian power in Asia
Minor, and was followed, after no long interval, by the entire
conquest of the Persian empire. The Persian control being now
removed from Asia Minor—while Alexander with the great Macedonian
force merely passed through it to the east, leaving viceroys behind
him—new hopes of independence or aggrandizement began to arise among
the native princes in Bithynia, Paphlagonia, and Kappadokia. The
Bithynian prince even contended successfully in the field against
Kalas, who had been appointed by Alexander as satrap in Phrygia.<a
id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a>
The Herakleot Dionysius, on the other hand, enemy by position of
these Bithynians, courted the new Macedonian potentates, playing
his political game with much skill in every way. He kept his forces
well in hand, and his dominions carefully guarded; he ruled in a
mild and popular manner, so as to preserve among the Herakleots
the same feelings of attachment which had been inspired by his
predecessor. While the citizens of the neighboring Sinôpê (as has
been already related) sent their envoys to Darius, Dionysius kept his
eyes upon Alexander; taking care to establish a footing at Pella,
and being peculiarly assiduous in attentions to Alexander’s sister,
the princess Kleopatra.<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090"
class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> He was the better qualified for this
courtly service, as he was a man of elegant and ostentatious
tastes, and had purchased from his namesake, the fallen Syracusan
Dionysius, all the rich furniture of the Dionysian family, highly
available for presents.<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091"
class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[p. 467]</span>By the favor
of Antipater and the regency at Pella, the Herakleotic despot was
enabled both to maintain and extend his dominions, until the return
of Alexander to Susa and Babylon in 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
All other authority was now superseded by the personal will of the
omnipotent conqueror; who, mistrusting all his delegates—Antipater,
the princesses, and the satraps—listened readily to complainants
from all quarters, and took particular pride in espousing the
pretensions of Grecian exiles. I have already recounted how in June
324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Alexander promulgated at the Olympic
festival a sweeping edict, directing that in every Grecian city the
exiles should be restored—by force, if force was required. Among
the various Grecian exiles, those from Herakleia were not backward
in soliciting his support, to obtain their own restoration, as
well as the expulsion of the despot. As they were entitled, along
with others, to the benefit of the recent edict, the position of
Dionysius became one of extreme danger. He now reaped the full
benefit of his antecedent prudence, in having maintained both his
popularity with the Herakleots at home, and his influence with
Antipater, to whom the enforcement of the edict was entrusted. He
was thus enabled to ward off the danger for a time; and his good
fortune rescued him from it altogether, by the death of Alexander
in June 323 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> That event, coming as it did
unexpectedly upon every one, filled Dionysius with such extravagant
joy, that he fell into a swoon: and he commemorated it by erecting
a statue in honor of Euthymia, or the tranquillizing goddess. His
position however seemed again precarious, when the Herakleotic exiles
renewed their solicitations to Perdikkas: who favored their cause,
and might probably have restored them, if he had chosen to direct
his march towards the Hellespont against Antipater and Kraterus,
instead of undertaking the ill-advised expedition against Egypt,
wherein he perished.<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092"
class="fnanchor">[1092]</a></p>

<p>The tide of fortune now turned more than ever in favor of
Dionysius. With Antipater and Kraterus, the preponderant potentates
in his neighborhood, he was on the best terms; and it happened
at this juncture to suit the political views of Kraterus to
dismiss his Persian wife Amastris (niece of the late Persian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[p. 468]</span> king Darius, and
conferred upon Kraterus by Alexander when he himself married
Statira), for the purpose of espousing Phila daughter of Antipater.
Amastris was given in marriage to Dionysius; for him, a splendid
exaltation—attesting the personal influence which he had previously
acquired. His new wife, herself a woman of ability and energy,
brought to him a large sum from the regal treasure, as well as
the means of greatly extending his dominion round Herakleia.
Noway corrupted by this good fortune, he still persevered both in
his conciliating rule at home, and his prudent alliances abroad,
making himself especially useful to Antigonus. That great chief,
preponderant throughout most parts of Asia Minor, was establishing
his ascendency in Bithynia and the neighborhood of the Propontis,
by founding the city of Antigonia in the rich plain adjoining
the Askanian Lake.<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093"
class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> Dionysius lent effective maritime aid
to Antigonus, in that war which ended by his conquest of Cyprus
from the Egyptian Ptolemy (307 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) To the
other Ptolemy, nephew and general of Antigonus, Dionysius gave his
daughter in marriage; and even felt himself powerful enough to assume
the title of king, after Antigonus, Lysimachus, and the Egyptian
Ptolemy had done the like.<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094"
class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> He died, after reigning thirty years
with consummate political skill and uninterrupted prosperity—except
that during the last few years he lost his health from excessive
corpulence.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095"
class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

<p>Dionysius left three children under age—Klearchus, Oxathres and
a daughter—by his wife Amastris; whom he constituted regent, and
who, partly through the cordial support of Antigonus, maintained
the Herakleotic dominion unimpaired. Presently Lysimachus, king
of Thrace and of the Thracian Chersonese (on the isthmus of
which he had founded the city of Lysimacheia), coveted this as a
valuable alliance, paid his court to Amastris, and married her. The
Herakleotic queen thus enjoyed double protection, and was enabled
to avoid taking a part in the formidable conflict of Ipsus (300
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); wherein the allies Lysimachus, Kassander,
Ptolemy, and Seleukus were victorious<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_469">[p. 469]</span> over Antigonus. The latter being
slain, and his Asiatic power crushed, Lysimachus got possession
of Antigonia, the recent foundation of his rival in Bithynia, and
changed its name to Nikæa.<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096"
class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> After a certain time, however, Lysimachus
became desirous of marrying Arsinoê, daughter of the Egyptian
Ptolemy; accordingly, Amastris divorced herself from him, and set up
for herself separately as regent of Herakleia. Her two sons being
now nearly of age, she founded and fortified, for her own residence,
the neighboring city of Amastris, about sixty miles eastward
of Herakleia on the coast of the Euxine.<a id="FNanchor_1097"
href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> These young men,
Klearchus and Oxathres, assumed the government of Herakleia, and
entered upon various warlike enterprises; of which we know only, that
Klearchus accompanied Lysimachus in his expedition against the Getæ,
sharing the fate of that prince, who was defeated and taken prisoner.
Both afterwards obtained their release, and Klearchus returned
to Herakleia; where he ruled in a cruel and oppressive manner,
and even committed the enormity (in conjunction with his brother
Oxathres) of killing his mother Amastris. This crime was avenged
by her former husband Lysimachus; who, coming to Herakleia under
professions of friendship (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 286), caused
Klearchus and Oxathres to be put to death, seized their treasure,
and keeping separate possession of the citadel only, allowed the
Herakleots to establish a popular government.<a id="FNanchor_1098"
href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a></p>

<p>Lysimachus, however, was soon persuaded by his wife Arsinoê
to make over Herakleia to her, as it had been formerly possessed
by Amastris; and Arsinoê sent thither a Kymæan officer named
Herakleides, who carried with him force sufficient to re-establish
the former despotism, with its oppressions and cruelties. For other
purposes too, not less mischievous, the influence of Arsinoê was
all-powerful. She prevailed upon Lysimachus to kill his eldest
son (by a former marriage) Agathokles, a young prince of the most
estimable and eminent qualities. Such an<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_470">[p. 470]</span> atrocity, exciting universal abhorrence
among the subjects of Lysimachus, enabled his rival Seleukus to
attack him with success. In a great battle fought between these two
princes, Lysimachus was defeated and slain—by the hand and javelin
of a citizen of Herakleia, named Malakon.<a id="FNanchor_1099"
href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>This victory transferred the dominions of the vanquished prince
to Seleukus. At Herakleia too, its effect was so powerful, that the
citizens were enabled to shake off their despotism. They at first
tried to make terms with the governor Herakleides, offering him money
as an inducement to withdraw. From him they obtained only an angry
refusal; yet his subordinate officers of mercenaries, and commanders
of detached posts in the Herakleotic territory, mistrusting their
own power of holding out, accepted an amicable compromise with the
citizens, who tendered to them full liquidation of arrears of pay,
together with the citizenship. The Herakleots were this enabled
to discard Herakleides, and regain their popular government.
They signalized their revolution by the impressive ceremony of
demolishing their Bastile—the detached fort or stronghold within the
city, which had served for eighty-four years as the characteristic
symbol, and indispensable engine, of the antecedent despotism.<a
id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a>
The city, now again a free commonwealth, was farther reinforced
by the junction of Nymphis (the historian) and other Herakleotic
citizens, who had hitherto been in exile. These men were restored,
and welcomed by their fellow-citizens in full friendship and
harmony; yet with express proviso, that no demand should be made
for the restitution of their properties, long since confiscated.<a
id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>
To the victor Seleukus, however, and his officer Aphrodisius, the
bold bearing of the newly-emancipated Herakleots proved offensive.
They would probably have incurred great danger from him, had not
his mind been first set upon the conquest of Macedonia in the
accomplishment of which he was murdered by Ptolemy Keraunus.</p>

<p>The Herakleots thus became again a commonwealth of free citizens,
without any detached citadel or mercenary garrison; yet they lost,
seemingly through the growing force and aggres<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_471">[p. 471]</span>sions of some inland dynasts, several
of their outlying dependencies—Kierus, Tium, and Amastris. The two
former they recovered some time afterwards by purchase, and they
wished also to purchase back Amastris; but Eumenes, who held it,
hated them so much, that he repudiated their money, and handed over
the place gratuitously to the Kappadokian chief Ariobarzanes.<a
id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a>
That their maritime power was at this time very great, we may see
by the astonishing account given of their immense ships,—numerously
manned, and furnished with many brave combatants on the deck—which
fought with eminent distinction in the naval battle between
Ptolemy Keraunus (murderer and successor of Seleukus) and
Antigonus Gonatas.<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103"
class="fnanchor">[1103]</a></p>

<p>It is not my purpose to follow lower down the destinies of
Herakleia. It maintained its internal autonomy, with considerable
maritime power, a dignified and prudent administration, and
a partial, though sadly circumscribed, liberty of foreign
action—until the successful war of the Romans against Mithridates
(<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 69). In Asia Minor, the Hellenic
cities on the coast were partly enabled to postpone the epoch of
their subjugation, by the great division of power which prevailed
in the interior; for the potentates, of Bithynia, Pergamus,
Kappadokia, Pontus, Syria, were in almost perpetual discord—while
all of them were menaced by the intrusion of the warlike and
predatory Gauls, who extorted for themselves settlements in
Galatia (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 276). The kings, the enemies
of civic freedom, were kept partially in check by these new and
formidable neighbors,<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104"
class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> who were themselves however hardly less
formidable to the Grecian cities on the coast.<a id="FNanchor_1105"
href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> Sinôpê,
Herakleia, Byzantium,—and even Rhodes, in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_472">[p. 472]</span> spite of the advantage of an
insular position,—isolated relics of what had once been an
Hellenic aggregate, become from henceforward cribbed and confined
by inland neighbors almost at their gates<a id="FNanchor_1106"
href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>—dependent on the
barbaric potentates, between whom they were compelled to trim, making
themselves useful in turn to all. It was however frequent with these
barbaric princes to derive their wives, mistresses, ministers,
negotiators, officers, engineers, literati, artists, actors, and
intermediate agents both for ornament and recreation—from some Greek
city. Among them all, more or less of Hellenic influence became thus
insinuated; along with the Greek language which spread its roots
everywhere—even among the Gauls or Galatians, the rudest and latest
of the foreign immigrants.</p>

<p>Of the Grecian maritime towns in the Euxine south of the
Danube—Apollonia, Mesembria, Odêssus, Kallatis, Tomi, and Istrus—five
(seemingly without Tomi) formed a confederate Pentapolis.<a
id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a>
About the year 312 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we hear of them as
under the power of Lysimachus king of Thrace, who kept a garrison
in Kallatis—probably in the rest also. They made a strug<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[p. 473]</span>gle to shake off his
yoke, obtaining assistance from some of the neighboring Thracians
and Scythians, as well as from Antigonus. But Lysimachus, after a
contest which seems to have lasted three or four years, overpowered
both their allies and them, reducing them again into subjection.<a
id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a>
Kallatis sustained a long siege, dismissing some of its ineffective
residents; who were received and sheltered by Eumelus prince of
Bosporus. It was in pushing his conquests yet farther northward, in
the steppe between the rivers Danube and Dniester, that Lysimachus
came into conflict with the powerful prince of the Getæ—Dromichætes;
by whom he was defeated and captured, but generously released.<a
id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a>
I have already mentioned that the empire of Lysimachus ended with his
last defeat and death by Seleukus—(281 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). By
his death, the cities of the Pontic Pentapolis regained a temporary
independence. But their barbaric neighbors became more and more
formidable, being reinforced seemingly by immigration of fresh
hordes from Asia; thus the Sarmatians, who in Herodotus’s time were
on the east of the Tanais, appear, three centuries afterwards, even
south of the Danube. By these tribes—Thracians, Getæ, Scythians, and
Sarmatians—the Greek cities of this Pentapolis were successively
pillaged. Though renewed indeed afterwards, from the necessity of
some place of traffic, even for the pillagers themselves—they were
but poorly renewed, with a large infusion of barbaric residents.<a
id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>
Such was the condition in which the exile Ovid found Tomi, near the
beginning of the Christian era. The Tomitans were more than half
barbaric, and their Greek not easily intelligible. The Sarmatian or
Getic horse-bowmen, with their poisoned arrows, ever hovered near,
galloped even up to the gates, and carried off the unwary cultivators
into slavery. Even within a furlong of the town, there was no
security either for person or property. The<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_474">[p. 474]</span> residents were clothed in skins, or
leather; while the women, ignorant both of spinning and weaving,
were employed either in grinding corn or in carrying on their heads
the pitchers of water.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111"
class="fnanchor">[1111]</a></p>

<p>By these same barbarians, Olbia also (on the right bank of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[p. 475]</span> Hypanis or
Bug near its mouth) became robbed of that comfort and prosperity
which it had enjoyed when visited by Herodotus. In his day, the
Olbians lived on good terms with the Scythian tribes in their
neighborhood. They paid a stipulated tribute, giving presents besides
to the prince and his immediate favorites; and on these conditions,
their persons and properties were respected. The Scythian prince
Skylês (son of an Hellenic mother from Istrus, who had familiarized
him with Greek speech and letters) had built a fine house in the
town, and spent in it a month, from attachment to Greek manners
and religion, while his Scythian army lay near the gates without
molesting any one.<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112"
class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> It is true, that this proceeding cost
Skylês his life; for the Scythians would not tolerate their own
prince in the practice of foreign religious rites, though they did
not quarrel with the same rites when observed by the Greeks.<a
id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>
To their own customs the Scythians adhered tenaciously, and those
customs were often sanguinary, ferocious, and brutish. Still they
were warriors, rather than robbers—they abstained from habitual
pillage, and maintained with the Greeks a reputation for honesty
and fair dealing, which became proverbial with the early poets.
Such were the Scythians as seen by Herodotus (probably about
440 to 430 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); and the picture drawn by
Ephorus a century afterwards (about 340 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
appears to have been not materially different.<a id="FNanchor_1114"
href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> But after that
time it gradually altered. New tribes seem to have come in—the
Sarmatians out of the East—the Gauls out of the West; from Thrace
northward to the Tanais and the Palus Mæotis, the most different
tribes became intermingled—Gauls, Thracians, Getæ, Scythians,
Sarmatians, etc.<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115"
class="fnanchor">[1115]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[p.
476]</span> Olbia was in an open plain, with no defence except its
walls and the adjoining river Hypanis, frozen over in the winter. The
hybrid Helleno-Scythian race, formed by intermarriages of Greeks with
Scythians—and the various Scythian tribes who had become partially
sedentary cultivators of corn for exportation—had probably also
acquired habits less warlike than the tribes of primitive barbaric
type. At any rate, even if capable of defending themselves, they
could not continue their production and commerce under repeated
hostile incursions.</p>

<p>A valuable inscription remaining enables us to compare the
Olbia (or Borysthenes) seen by Herodotus, with the same town in
the second century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a id="FNanchor_1116"
href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> At this latter
period, the city was diminished in population, impoverished in
finances, exposed to constantly increasing exactions and menace from
the passing barbaric hordes, and scarcely able to defend against
them even the security of its walls. Sometimes there approached
the barbaric chief Saitapharnes with his personal suite, sometimes
his whole tribe or horde in mass, called Saii. Whenever they
came, they required to be appeased by presents, greater than the
treasury could supply, and borrowed only from the voluntary help of
rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[p. 477]</span> citizens;
while even these presents did not always avert ill treatment or
pillage. Already the citizens of Olbia had repelled various attacks,
partly by taking into pay a semi-Hellenic population in their
neighborhood (Mix-Hellenes, like the Liby-Phenicians in Africa); but
the inroads became more alarming, and their means of defence less,
through the uncertain fidelity of these Mix-Hellenes, as well as
of their own slaves—the latter probably barbaric natives purchased
from the interior.<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117"
class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> In the midst of public poverty, it was
necessary to enlarge and strengthen the fortifications; for they were
threatened with the advent of the Gauls—who inspired such terror that
the Scythians and other barbarians were likely to seek their own
safety by extorting admission within the walls of Olbia. Moreover
even corn was scarce, and extravagantly dear. There had been repeated
failures in the produce of the lands around, famine was apprehended,
and efforts were needed, greater than the treasury could sustain,
to lay in a stock at the public expense. Among the many points of
contrast with Herodotus, this is perhaps the most striking; for in
his time, corn was the great produce and the principal export from
Olbia; the growth had now been suspended, or was at least perpetually
cut off, by increased devastation and insecurity.</p>

<p>After perpetual attacks, and even several captures, by
barbaric neighbors—this unfortunate city, about fifty years
before the Christian era, was at length so miserably sacked by
the Getæ, as to become for a time abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_1118"
href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> Presently,
however, the fugitives partially returned, to re-establish
themselves on a reduced scale. For the very same barbarians who
had persecuted and plundered them, still required an emporium with
a certain amount of import and export, such as none but Greek
settlers could provide; moreover it was from the coast near Olbia,
and from care of its inhabitants, that many of the neigh<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[p. 478]</span>boring tribes derived
their supply of salt.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119"
class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> Hence arose a puny after-growth of
Olbia—preserving the name, traditions, and part of the locality, of
the deserted city—by the return of a portion of the colonists with an
infusion of Scythian or Sarmatian residents; an infusion indeed so
large, as seriously to dishellenize both the speech and the personal
names in the town.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120"
class="fnanchor">[1120]</a></p>

<p>To this second edition of Olbia, the rhetor Dion Chrysostom
paid a summer visit (about a century after the Christian era), of
which he has left a brief but interesting account. Within the wide
area once filled by the original Olbia—the former circumference
of which was marked by crumbling walls and towers—the second town
occupied a narrow corner; with poor houses, low walls, and temples
having no other ornament except the ancient statues mutilated
by the plunderers. The citizens dwelt in perpetual insecurity,
constantly under arms or on guard; for the barbaric horsemen,
in spite of sentinels posted to announce their approach, often
carried off prisoners, cattle, or property, from the immediate
neighborhood of the gates. The picture drawn of Olbia by Dion
confirms in a remarkable way that given of Tomi by Ovid. And what
imparts to it a touching interest is, that the Greeks whom Dion saw
contending with the difficulties, privations, and dangers of this
inhospitable outpost, still retained the activity, the elegance, and
the intellectual aspirations of their Ionic breed; in this respect
much superior to the Tomitans of Ovid. In particular, they were
passionate admirers of Homer; a considerable proportion of the Greeks
of Olbia could repeat the Iliad from memory.<a id="FNanchor_1121"
href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> Achilles
(localized under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[p. 479]</span>
the surname of Pontarches, on numerous islands and capes in the
Euxine) was among the chief divine or heroic persons to whom they
addressed their prayers.<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122"
class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> Amidst Grecian life, thus degraded and
verging towards its extinction, and stripped even of the purity of
living speech—the thread of imaginative and traditional sentiment
thus continues without suspension or abatement.</p>

<p>Respecting Bosporus or Pantikapæum (for both names denote the
same city, though the former name often comprehends the whole
annexed dominion), founded by Milesian settlers<a id="FNanchor_1123"
href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> on the European
side of the Kimmerian Bosporus (near Kertsch), we first hear,
about the period when Xerxes was repulsed from Greece (480-479
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). It was the centre of a dominion
including Phanagoria, Kepi, Hermonassa, and other Greek cities on
the Asiatic side of the strait; and is said to have been governed
by what seems to have been an oligarchy—called the Archæanaktidæ,
for forty-two years<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124"
class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> (480-438 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>).</p>

<p>After them we have a series of princes standing out
individually by name, and succeeding each other in the same
family. Spartokus I. was succeeded by Seleukus; next comes
Spartokus II.; then Satyrus I. (407-393 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>);
Leukon (393-353 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); Spartokus III.
(353-348 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); Parisades I. (348-310
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); Satyrus II., Prytanis, Eumelus
(310-304 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); Spartokus IV. (304-284
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); Parisades II.<a id="FNanchor_1125"
href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> During the reigns
of these princes, a connection of some intimacy subsisted between
Athens and Bosporus; a connection not political, since the Bosporanic
princes had little interest in the contentions about Hellenic
hegemony—but of private intercourse, commercial interchange, and
reciprocal good offices. The eastern corner of the Tauric Cher<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[p. 480]</span>sonesus, between
Pantikapæum and Theodosia, was well-suited for the production of
corn; while plenty of fish, as well as salt, was to be had in or
near the Palus Mæotis. Corn, salted fish and meat, hides, and
barbaric slaves in considerable numbers, were in demand among all
the Greeks round the Ægean, and not least at Athens, where Scythian
slaves were numerous;<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126"
class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> while oil and wine, with other products
of more southern regions, were acceptable in Bosporus and the other
Pontic ports. This important traffic seems to have been mainly
carried on in ships and by capital belonging to Athens and other
Ægean maritime towns; and must have been greatly under the protection
and regulation of the Athenians, so long as their maritime empire
subsisted. Enterprising citizens of Athens went to Bosporus (as
to Thrace and the Thracian Chersonesus), to push their fortunes;
merchants from other cities found it advantageous to settle as
resident strangers or metics at Athens, where they were more in
contact with the protecting authority, and obtained readier access to
the judicial tribunals. It was probably during the period preceding
the great disaster at Syracuse in 413 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that
Athens first acquired her position as a mercantile centre for the
trade with the Euxine; which we afterwards find her retaining, even
with reduced power, in the time of Demosthenes.</p>

<p>How strong was the position enjoyed by Athens in Bosporus, during
her unimpaired empire, we may judge from the fact, that Nymphæum
(south of Pantikapæum, between that town and Theodosia) was among
her tributary towns, and paid a talent an<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_481">[p. 481]</span>nually.<a id="FNanchor_1127"
href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> Not until the
misfortunes of Athens in the closing years of the Peloponnesian war,
did Nymphæum pass into the hands of the Bosporanic princes; betrayed
(according to Æschines) by the maternal grandfather of Demosthenes,
the Athenian Gylon; who however probably did nothing more than obey a
necessity rendered unavoidable by the fallen condition of Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>
We thus see that Nymphæum, in the midst of the Bosporanic dominion,
was not only a member of the Athenian empire, but also contained
influential Athenian citizens, engaged in the corn-trade. Gylon
was rewarded by a large grant of land at Kepi—probably other
Athenians of Nymphæum were rewarded also—by the Bosporanic prince;
who did not grudge a good price for such an acquisition. We find
also other instances,—both of Athenian citizens sent out to reside
with the prince Satyrus,—and of Pontic Greeks who, already in
correspondence and friendship with various individual Athenians,
consign their sons to be initiated in the commerce, society, and
refinements of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129"
class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> Such facts attest the correspondence
and intercourse of that city, during her imperial greatness, with
Bosporus.</p>

<p>The Bosporanic prince Satyrus was in the best relations with
Athens, and even seems to have had authorized representatives there
to enforce his requests, which met with very great attention.<a
id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a>
He treated the Athenian merchants at Bosporus with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[p. 482]</span> equity and even favor,
granting to them a preference in the export of corn when there was
not enough for all.<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131"
class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> His son Leukon not only continued the
preference to Athenian exporting ships, but also granted to them
remission of the export duty (of one-thirtieth part), which he
exacted from all other traders. Such an exemption is reckoned as
equivalent to an annual present of 13,000 medimni of corn (the
medimnus being about 1⅓ bushel); the total quantity of corn brought
from Bosporus to Athens in a full year being 400,000 medimni.<a
id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>
It is easy to see moreover that such a premium must have thrown
nearly the whole exporting trade into the hands of Athenian
merchants. The Athenians requited this favor by public votes of
gratitude and honor, conferring upon Leukon the citizenship, together
with immunity from all the regular burthens attaching to property at
Athens. There was lying in that city money belonging to Leukon;<a
id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a>
who was therefore open (under the proposition of Leptines) to that
conditional summons for exchange of properties, technically termed
Antidosis. In his time, moreover, the corn-trade of Bosporus appears
to have been farther extended; for we learn that he established an
export from Theodosia as well as from Pantikapæum. His successor
Parisades I. continuing to Athenian exporters of corn the same
privilege of immunity from export duty, obtained from Athens still
higher honors than Leukon; for we learn that his statue, together
with those of two relatives, was erected in the agora, on the
motion of Demosthenes.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134"
class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> The connection of Bosporus with
Athens was durable as well as intimate; its corn-trade being of
high importance to the subsistence of the people. Every Athenian
exporter was bound by law to bring his cargo in the first instance
to Athens. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[p. 483]</span>
freighting and navigating of ships for that purpose, together with
the advance of money by rich capitalists (citizens and metics)
upon interest and conditions enforced by the Athenian judicature,
was a standing and profitable business. And we may appreciate the
value of equitable treatment, not to say favor, from the kings of
Bosporus—when we contrast it with the fraudulent and extortionate
behavior of Kleomenes, satrap of Egypt, in reference to the export
of Egyptian corn.<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135"
class="fnanchor">[1135]</a></p>

<p>The political condition of the Greeks at Bosporus was somewhat
peculiar. The hereditary princes (above enumerated), who ruled
them substantially as despots, assumed no other title (in respect
to the Greeks) than that of Archon. They paid tribute to the
powerful Scythian tribes who bounded them on the European side,
and even thought it necessary to carry a ditch across the narrow
isthmus, from some point near Theodosia northward to the Palus
Mæotis, as a protection against incursions.<a id="FNanchor_1136"
href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> Their dominion
did not extend farther west than Theodosia; this ditch was their
extreme western boundary; and even for the land within it, they paid
tribute. But on the Asiatic side of the strait, they were lords
paramount for a considerable distance, over the feebler and less
warlike tribes who pass under the common name of Mæotæ or Mæêtae—the
Sindi, Toreti, Dandarii, Thatês, etc. Inscriptions, yet remaining,
of Parisades I. record him as King of these various barbaric tribes,
but as Archon of Bosporus and Theodosia.<a id="FNanchor_1137"
href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> His dominion on
the Asiatic side of the Kimmerian Bosporus, sustained by Grecian and
Thracian mercenaries, was of considerable (though to us un<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[p. 484]</span>known) extent, reaching
to somewhere near the borders of Caucasus.<a id="FNanchor_1138"
href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a></p>

<p>Parisades I. on his death left three sons—Satyrus, Prytanis,
and Eumelus. Satyrus, as the eldest, succeeded; but Eumelus
claimed the crown, sought aid without, and prevailed on various
neighbors—among them a powerful Thracian king named Ariopharnes—to
espouse his cause. At the head of an army said to consist of
20,000 horse and 22,000 foot, the two allies marched to attack
the territories of Satyrus, who advanced to meet them, with 2000
Grecian mercenaries, and 2000 Thracians of his own, reinforced by
a numerous body of Scythian allies—20,000 foot, and 10,000 horse,
and carrying with him a plentiful supply of provisions in waggons.
He gained a complete victory, compelling Eumelus and Ariopharnes
to retreat and seek refuge in the regal residence of the latter,
near the river Thapsis; a fortress built of timber, and surrounded
with forest, river, marsh, and rock, so as to be very difficult
of approach. Satyrus, having first plundered the country around,
which supplied a rich booty of prisoners and cattle, proceeded to
assail his enemies in their almost impracticable position. But
though he, and Meniskus his general of mercenaries, made the most
strenuous efforts, and even carried some of the outworks, they were
repulsed from the fortress itself; and Satyrus, exposing himself
forwardly to extricate Meniskus, received a wound of which he shortly
died—after a reign of nine months. Meniskus, raising the siege,
withdrew the army to Gargaza; from whence he conveyed back the regal
corpse to Pantikapæum.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139"
class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[p. 485]</span>Prytanis, the
next brother, rejecting an offer of partition tendered by Eumelus,
assumed the sceptre, and marched forth to continue the struggle.
But the tide of fortune now turned in favor of Eumelus; who took
Gargaza with several other places, worsted his brother in battle,
and so blocked him up in the isthmus near the Palus Mæotis, that
he was forced to capitulate and resign his pretensions. Eumelus
entered Pantikapæum as conqueror. Nevertheless, the defeated
Prytanis, in spite of his recent covenant, made a renewed attempt
upon the crown; wherein he was again baffled, forced to escape to
Kêpi, and there slain. To assure himself of the throne, Eumelus put
to death the wives and children of both his two brothers, Satyrus
and Prytanis—together with all their principal friends. One youth
alone—Parisades, son of Satyrus—escaped and found protection with the
Scythian prince Agarus.</p>

<p>Eumelus had now put down all rivals; yet his recent cruelties
had occasioned wrath and disgust among the Bosporanic citizens. He
convoked them in assembly, to excuse his past conduct, and promised
good government for the future; at the same time guaranteeing to them
their full civic constitution, with such privileges and immunities
as they had before enjoyed, and freedom from direct taxation.<a
id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a>
Such assurances, combined probably with an imposing mercenary force,
appeased or at least silenced the prevailing disaffection. Eumelus
kept his promises so far as to govern in a mild and popular spirit.
While thus rendering himself acceptable at home, he maintained
an energetic foreign policy, and made several conquests among
the surrounding tribes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[p.
486]</span> He constituted himself a sort of protector of the
Euxine, repressing the piracies of the Heniochi and Achæi (among
the Caucasian mountains to the east) as well as of the Tauri in the
Chersonesus (Crimea); much to the satisfaction of the Byzantines,
Sinopians, and other Pontic Greeks. He received a portion of the
fugitives from Kallatis, when besieged by Lysimachus, and provided
for them a settlement in his dominions. Having thus acquired
great reputation, Eumelus was in the full career of conquest and
aggrandizement, when an accident terminated his life, after a
reign of rather more than five years. In returning from Scythia to
Pantikapæum, in a four-wheeled carriage (or waggon) and four with
a tent upon it, his horses took fright and ran away. Perceiving
that they were carrying him towards a precipice, he tried to
jump out; but his sword becoming entangled in the wheel, he was
killed on the spot.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141"
class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> He was succeeded by his son Spartokus
IV., who reigned twenty years (304-284 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>);
afterwards came the son of Spartokus, Parisades II.; with
whose name our information breaks off.<a id="FNanchor_1142"
href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a></p>

<p>This dynasty, the Spartokidæ, though they ruled the Greeks of
Bosporus as despots by means of a foreign mercenary force—yet seem to
have exercised power with equity and moderation.<a id="FNanchor_1143"
href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> Had Eumelus lived,
he might probably have established an extensive empire over the
barbaric tribes on all sides of him. But empire over such subjects
was seldom permanent; nor did his successors long maintain even as
much as he left. We have no means of following their fortunes in
detail; but we know that about a century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
the then reigning prince, Parisades IV., found himself so pressed and
squeezed by the Scythians,<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144"
class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> that he was forced (like Olbia
and the Pentapolis) to forego his inde<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_487">[p. 487]</span>pendence; and to call in, as auxiliary
or master, the formidable Mithridates Eupator of Pontus; from whom a
new dynasty of Bosporanic kings began—subject however after no long
interval, to the dominion and interference of Rome.</p>

<p>These Mithridatic princes lie beyond our period; but the cities
of Bosporus under the Spartokid princes, in the fourth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, deserve to be ranked among the conspicuous
features of the living Hellenic world. They were not indeed purely
Hellenic, but presented a considerable admixture of Scythian or
Oriental manners; analogous to the mixture of the Hellenic and
Libyan elements at Kyrênê with its Battiad princes. Among the
facts attesting the wealth and power of these Spartokid princes,
and of the Bosporanic community, we may number the imposing groups
of mighty sepulchral tumuli near Kertch (Pantikapæum); some of
which have been recently examined, while the greater part still
remain unopened. These spacious chambers of stone—enclosed in
vast hillocks (Kurgans), cyclopian works piled up with prodigious
labor and cost—have been found to contain not only a profusion of
ornaments of the precious metals (gold, silver, and electron, or a
mixture of four parts of gold to one of silver), but also numerous
vases, implements, and works of art, illustrating the life and
ideas of the Bosporanic population. “The contents of the tumuli
already opened are so multifarious, that from the sepulchres of
Pantikapæum alone, we might become acquainted with everything which
served the Greeks either for necessary use, or for the decoration
of domestic life.”<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145"
class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> Statues, reliefs and frescoes on the
walls, have been found, on varied subjects both of war and peace, and
often of very fine execution; besides these, numerous carvings in
wood, and vessels of bronze or terra cotta; with necklaces, armlets,
bracelets, rings, drinking cups, etc. of precious metal—several with
colored beads attached.<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146"
class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> The costumes, equipment, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[p. 488]</span> physiognomy
represented, are indeed a mixture of Hellenic and barbaric; moreover,
even the profusion of gold chains and other precious ornaments,
indicates a tone of sentiment partially orientalized, in those for
whom they were destined.</p>

<p>But the design as well as the execution comes clearly out of the
Hellenic workshop; and there is good ground for believing, that in
the fourth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Pantikapæum was the
seat, not only of enterprising and wealthy citizens, but also of
strenuous and well-directed artistic genius. Such manifestations of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[p. 489]</span> refinements
of Hellenism, in this remote and little-noticed city, form an
important addition to the picture of Hellas as a whole,—prior to its
days of subjection,—which it has been the purpose of this history to
present.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>I have now brought down the history of Greece to the point
of time marked out in the Preface to my First Volume—the close
of the generation contemporary with Alexander—the epoch, from
whence dates not only the extinction of Grecian political freedom
and self-action, but also the decay of productive genius, and
the debasement of that consummate literary and rhetorical
excellence which the fourth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> had
seen exhibited in Plato and Demosthenes.<a id="FNanchor_1147"
href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> The contents of
this last Volume indicate but too clearly that Greece as a separate
subject of history no longer exists; for one full half of it is
employed in depicting Alexander and his conquests—ἄγριον αἰχμητὴν,
κρατερὸν μήστωρα φόβοιο<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148"
class="fnanchor">[1148]</a>—that Non-Hellenic conqueror into
whose vast possessions the Greeks are absorbed, with their
intellectual brightness bedimmed, their spirit broken, and half
their virtue taken away by Zeus—the melancholy emasculation
inflicted (according to Homer) upon victims overtaken by the
day of slavery.<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149"
class="fnanchor">[1149]</a></p>

<p>One branch of intellectual energy there was, and one alone, which
continued to flourish, comparatively little impaired, under the
preponderance of the Macedonian sword—the spirit of speculation and
philosophy. During the century which we have<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_490">[p. 490]</span> just gone through, this spirit was
embodied in several eminent persons, whose names have been scarcely
adverted to in this history. Among these names, indeed, there are
two, of peculiar grandeur, whom I have brought partially before the
reader, because both of them belong to general history as well as to
philosophy; Plato, as citizen of Athens, companion of Sokrates at
his trial, and counsellor of Dionysius in his glory—Aristotle, as
the teacher of Alexander. I had at one time hoped to include in my
present work a record of them as philosophers also, and an estimate
of their speculative characteristics; but I find the subject far too
vast to be compressed into such a space as this volume would afford.
The exposition of the tenets of distinguished thinkers is not now
numbered by historians, either ancient or modern, among the duties
incumbent upon them, nor yet among the natural expectations of their
readers; but is reserved for the special historian of philosophy.
Accordingly, I have brought my history of Greece to a close, without
attempting to do justice either to Plato or to Aristotle. I hope to
contribute something towards supplying this defect, the magnitude
of which I fully appreciate, in a separate work, devoted specially
to an account of Greek speculative philosophy in the fourth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

  <p class="center">ON ISSUS AND ITS NEIGHBORHOOD, AS CONNECTED WITH THE WAR.</p>
</div>

<div class="appendix">

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">The</span> exact battle-field of
Issus cannot be certainly assigned, upon the evidence accessible to
us. But it may be determined, within a few miles north or south; and
what is even more important—the general features of the locality, as
well as the preliminary movements of the contending armies, admit of
being clearly conceived and represented.</p>

<p>That the battle was fought in some portion of the narrow space
intervening between the eastern coast of the Gulf of Issus and the
western flank of Mount Amanus—that Alexander’s left and Darius’s
right, rested on the sea, and their right and left respectively on
the mountain—that Darius came upon Alexander unexpectedly from the
rear, thus causing him to return back a day’s march from Myriandrus,
and to reoccupy a pass which he had already passed through and
quitted—these points are clearly given, and appear to me not open to
question. We know that the river Pinarus, on which the battle was
fought, was at a certain distance <i>south</i> of Issus, the last town of
Kilikia before entering Syria (Arrian, ii. 7. 2)—ἐς δὲ τὴν ὑστεραίαν
προὐχώρει (Darius from Issus) ἐπὶ τὸν ποταμὸν τὸν Πίναρον—Ritter
erroneously states that Issus was <i>upon</i> the river Pinarus, which
he even calls <i>the Issus river</i> (Erdkunde, Theil iv. Abth. 2. p.
1797-1806). We know also that this river was at some distance <i>north</i>
of the maritime pass called the Gates of Kilikia and Assyria, through
which Alexander passed and repassed.</p>

<p>But when we proceed, beyond these data (the last of them only
vague and relative), to fix the exact battle-field, we are reduced to
conjecture. Dr. Thirlwall, in an appendix to the sixth volume of his
history, has collected and discussed very ably the different opinions
of various geographers.</p>

<p>To those whom he has cited, may be added—Mr. Ainsworth’s Essay
on the Cilician and Syrian Gates (in the Transactions of the
Geographical Society for 1837)—Mützel’s Topographical Notes on
the third book of Quintus Curtius—and the last volume of Ritter’s
Erdkunde, published only this year (1855), ch. xxvii. p. 1778
<i>seqq.</i></p>

<p>We know from Xenophon that Issus was a considerable town close
to the sea—two days’ march from the river Pyramus, and one day’s
march northward of the maritime pass called the Gates of Kilikia
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[p. 492]</span> Syria.
That it was near the north-eastern corner of the Gulf, may also be
collected from Strabo, who reckons the shortest line across Asia
Minor, as stretching from Sinôpê or Amisus <i>to Issus</i>—and who also
lays down the Egyptian sea as having its northern termination <i>at
Issus</i> (Strabo, xiv. p. 677; xvi. p. 749). The probable site of
Issus has been differently determined by different authors; Rennell
(Illustrations of the Geography of the Anabasis, p. 42-48) places
it near Oseler or Yusler; as far as I can judge, this seems too far
distant from the head of the Gulf, towards the south.</p>

<p>In respect to the maritime pass, called the Gates of Kilikia
and Syria, there is much discrepancy between Xenophon and Arrian.
It is evident that, in Xenophon’s time, this pass and the road of
march through it lay between the mountains and the sea,—and that
the obstructions (walls blocking up the passage), which he calls
insurmountable by force, were mainly of artificial creation. But when
Alexander passed, no walls existed. The artificial obstructions had
disappeared during the seventy years between Xenophon and Alexander;
and we can assign a probable reason why. In Xenophon’s time, Kilikia
was occupied by the native prince Syennesis, who, though tributary,
maintained a certain degree of independence even in regard to the
Great King, and therefore kept a wall guarded by his own soldiers
on his boundary towards Syria. But in Alexander’s time, Kilikia
was occupied, like Syria, by a Persian satrap. Artificial boundary
walls, between two conterminous satrapies under the same master, were
unnecessary; and must even have been found inconvenient, during the
great collective military operations of the Persian satraps against
the revolted Evagoras of Cyprus (principally carried on from Kilikia
as a base, about 380 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Diodor. xv. 2)—as
well as in the subsequent operations against the Phenician towns
(Diodor. xvi. 42). Hence we may discern a reason why all artificial
obstructions may have been swept away before the time of Alexander;
leaving only the natural difficulties of the neighboring ground, upon
which Xenophon has not touched.</p>

<p>The spot still retained its old name—“The Gates of Kilikia and
Syria”—even after walls and gates had been dispensed with. But that
name, in Arrian’s description, designates a difficult and narrow
point of the road <i>over hills and rocks</i>; a point which Major Rennell
(Illustrations, p. 54) supposes to have been about a mile south of
the river and walls described by Xenophon. However this may be, the
precise spot designated by Xenophon seems probably to be sought
about seven miles north of Scanderoon, near the ruins now known as
Jonas’s Pillars (or Sakal Tutan), and the Castle of Merkes, where a
river called <i>Merkes</i>, <i>Mahersy</i>, or <i>Kara-su</i>, flows across from the
mountain to the sea. That this river is the same with the Kersus of
Xenophon, is the opinion of Rennell, Ainsworth, and Mützel; as well
as of Colonel Callier, who surveyed the country when accompanying
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[p. 493]</span> army of
Ibrahim Pacha as engineer (cited by Ritter, Erdk. p. 1792). At the
spot here mentioned, the gulf indents eastward, while the western
flank of Amanus approaches very close to it, and drops with unusual
steepness towards it. Hence the road now followed does not pass
between the mountain and the sea, but ascends over a portion of the
mountain, and descends again afterwards to the low ground skirting
the sea. Northward of Merkes, the space between the mountain and
the sea gradually widens, towards Bayas. At some distance to the
north of Bayas occurs the river now called Delle Tschai, which is
considered I think with probability, to be the Pinarus, where the
battle between Alexander and Darius was fought. This opinion however
is not unanimous; Kinneir identifies the <i>Merkes</i> with the Pinarus.
Moreover, there are several different streams which cross the space
between Mount Amanus and the sea. Des Monceaux notices six streams
as having been crossed between the Castle of Merkes and Bayas; and
five more streams between Bayas and Ayas (Mützel ad Curtium, p. 105).
Which among these is the Pinarus, cannot be settled without more or
less of doubt.</p>

<p>Besides the Gates of Kilikia and Syria, noted by Xenophon and
Arrian in the above passages, there are also other Gates called <i>the
Amanian Gates</i>, which are spoken of in a perplexing manner. Dr.
Thirlwall insists with propriety on the necessity of distinguishing
the <i>maritime</i> passes, between Mount Amanus and the sea—from the
<i>inland</i> passes, which crossed over the ridge of Mount Amanus
itself. But this distinction seems not uniformly observed by ancient
authors, when we compare Strabo, Arrian, and Kallisthenes. Strabo
uses the phrase, <i>Amanian Gates</i>, twice (xiv. p. 676; xvi. p. 751);
in both cases designating a <i>maritime pass</i>, and not a pass <i>over</i>
the mountain,—yet designating one maritime pass in the page first
referred to, and another in the second. In xiv. p. 676—he means by
αἱ Ἀμανίδες πύλαι, the spot called by modern travellers Demir Kapu,
between Ægæ and Issus, or between Mopsuestia and Issus; while in xvi.
751—he means by the same words that which I have been explaining as
the Gates of Kilikia and Syria, on the eastern side of the Gulf of
Issus. In fact, Strabo seems to conceive as a whole the strip of
land between Mount Amanus and the Gulf, beginning at Demir Kapu,
and ending at the Gates of Kilikia and Syria—and to call both the
beginning and the end of it by the same name—the Amanian Gates.
But he does not use this last phrase to designate the passage over
or across Mount Amanus; neither does Arrian; who in describing the
march of Darius from Sochi into Kilikia, says (ii. 7, 1)—ὑπερβαλὼν
δὴ τὸ ὄρος Δαρεῖος τὸ κατὰ τὰς πύλας τὰς Ἀμανικὰς καλουμένας, ὡς ἐπὶ
Ἴσσον προῆγε, καὶ ἐγένετο κατόπιν Ἀλεξάνδρου λαθών. Here, let it be
observed, we do not read ὑπερβαλὼν τὰς πύλας—nor can I think that the
words mean, as the translator gives them—“transiit Amanum, <i>eundo
per Pylas Amanicas</i>.” The words rather signify, that Darius<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[p. 494]</span> “crossed over the
mountain where it adjoined the Amanian Gates”—<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> where it
adjoined the strip of land skirting the Gulf, and lying between those
two extreme points which Strabo denominates <i>Amanian Gates</i>. Arrian
employs this last phrase more loosely than Strabo, yet still with
reference to the maritime strip, and not to a <i>col</i> over the mountain
ridge.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Kallisthenes (if he is rightly represented by
Polybius, who recites his statement, not his words, xii. 17) uses the
words <i>Amanian Gates</i> to signify the passage by which Darius entered
Kilikia—that is, the passage <i>over</i> the mountain. That which Xenophon
and Arrian call the <i>Gates of Kilikia and Syria</i>—and which Strabo
calls <i>Amanian Gates</i>—is described by Polybius as τὰ στενὰ, καὶ τὰς
λεγομένας ἐν τῇ Κιλικίᾳ πύλας.</p>

<p>It seems pretty certain that this must have been Darius’s line of
march, because he came down immediately upon Issus, and then marched
forward to the river Pinarus. Had he entered Kilikia by the pass of
Beylan, he must have passed the Pinarus <i>before</i> he reached Issus.
The positive grounds for admitting a practicable pass near the 37th
parallel, are indeed called in question by Mützel (ad Curtium, p.
102, 103), and are not in themselves conclusive; still I hold them
sufficient, when taken in conjunction with the probabilities of the
case. This pass was, however, we may suppose, less frequented than
the maritime line of road through the Gates of Kilikia and Syria, and
the pass of Beylan; which, as the more usual, was preferred both by
the Cyreians and by Alexander.</p>

<p>Respecting the march of Alexander, Dr. Thirlwall here starts a
question, substantially to this effect: “Since Alexander intended
to march through the pass of Beylan for the purpose of attacking
the Persian camp at Sochi, what could have caused him to go to
Myriandrus, which was more south than Beylan, and out of his road?”
Dr. Thirlwall feels this difficulty so forcibly, that in order
to eliminate it, he is inclined to accept the hypothesis of Mr.
Williams, which places Myriandrus at Bayas, and the Kiliko-Syrian
Gates at Demir-Kapu; an hypothesis which appears to me inadmissible
on various grounds, and against which Mr. Ainsworth (in his Essay on
the Cilician and Syrian Gates) has produced several very forcible
objections.</p>

<p>I confess that I do not feel the difficulty on which Dr. Thirlwall
insists. When we see that Cyrus and the Ten Thousand went to
Myriandrus, in their way to the pass of Beylan, we may reasonably
infer that, whether that town was in the direct line or not, it was
at least in the <i>usual</i> road of march—which does not always coincide
with the direct line. But to waive this supposition, however—let us
assume that there existed another shorter road leading to Beylan
without passing by Myriandrus—there would still be reason enough to
induce Alexander to go somewhat out of his way, in order to visit
Myriandrus. For it was an important object with him to secure the
sea ports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[p. 495]</span> in
his rear, in case of a possible reverse. Suppose him repulsed and
forced to retreat—it would be a material assistance to his retreat,
to have assured himself beforehand of Myriandrus as well as the
other seaports. In the approaching months, we shall find him just as
careful to make sure of the Phenician cities on the coast, before he
marches into the interior to attack Darius at Arbela.</p>

<p>Farther, Alexander, marching to attack Darius, had nothing to gain
by haste, and nothing to lose by coming up to Sochi three days later.
He knew that the enormous Persian host would not try to escape;
it would either await him at Sochi, or else advance into Kilikia
to attack him there. The longer he tarried, the more likely they
were to do the latter, which was what he desired. He had nothing to
lose therefore in any way, and some chance of gain, by prolonging
his march to Sochi for as long a time as was necessary to secure
Myriandrus. There is no more difficulty, I think, in understanding
why he went to Myriandrus, than why he went westward from Tarsus
(still more out of his line of advance) to Soli and Anchialus.</p>

<p>It seems probable (as Rennell, p. 56, and others think), that the
site of Myriandrus is now some distance inland; that there has been
an accretion of new land and morass on the coast.</p>

<p>The modern town of Scanderoon occupies the site of Ἀλεξανδρεία
κατ᾽ Ἴσσον, founded (probably by order of Alexander himself) in
commemoration of the victory of Issus. According to Ritter (p. 1791),
“Alexander had the great idea of establishing there an emporium for
the traffic of the East with Europe, as at the other Alexandria for
the trade of the East with Egypt.” The importance of the site of
Scanderoon, in antiquity, is here greatly exaggerated. I know no
proof that Alexander had the idea which Ritter ascribes to him; and
it is certain that his successors had no such idea; because they
founded the great cities of Antioch and Seleukeia (in Pieria), both
of them carrying the course of trade up the Orontes, and therefore
diverting it away from Scanderoon. This latter town is only of
importance as being the harbor of Aleppo; a city (Berœa) of little
consequence in antiquity, while Antioch became the first city in the
East, and Seleukeia among the first: see Ritter, p. 1152.</p>

life of Demetrius Poliorkêtês; which presents a vivid description
of the feelings prevalent between members of regal families in
those ages. Demetrius, coming home from the chase with his hunting
javelins in his hand, goes up to his father Antigonus, salutes him,
and sits down by his side without disarming. This is extolled as
an unparalleled proof of the confidence and affection subsisting
between the father and the son. In the families of all the other
Diadochi (says Plutarch) murders of sons, mothers, and wives,
were frequent—murders of brothers were even common, assumed to be
precautions necessary for security. Οὕτως ἄρα πάντη δυσκωνοίνητον ἡ
ἀρχὴ καὶ μεστὸν ἀπιστίας καὶ δυσνοίας, ὥστε ἀγάλλεσθαι τὸν μέγιστον
τῶν Ἀλεξάνδρου διαδόχων καὶ πρεσβύτατον, ὅτι μὴ φοβεῖται τὸν υἱὸν,

<p>Compare Tacitus, Histor. v. 8, about the family feuds of the
kings of Judæa; and Xenoph. Hieron. iii. 8.</p>

<p>In noticing the Antigonid family as a favorable exception, we
must confine our assertion to the first century of that family. The
bloody tragedy of Perseus and Demetrius shortly preceded the ruin of
the empire.</p>

Arrian mentioned this Amyntas son of Perdikkas (as well as the fact
of his having been put to death by Alexander before the Asiatic
expedition), in the lost work τὰ μετὰ Ἀλέξανδρον—see Photius Cod.
92. p. 220. But Arrian, in his account of Alexander’s expedition,
<i>does not mention</i> the fact; which shows that his silence is not to
be assumed as a conclusive reason for discrediting allegations of
others.</p>

<p>Compare Polyænus, v. 60; and Plutarch, Fort. Alex. Magn. p. 327.
</p>

<p>It was during this expedition into Thrace and Illyria, about
eight months after his accession, that Alexander promised to give his
sister Kynna in marriage to Langarus prince of the Agrianes (Arrian,
Exp. Al. M. i. 5, 7). Langarus died of sickness soon after; so that
this marriage never took place. But when the promise was made, Kynna
must have been a widow. Her husband Amyntas must therefore have been
put to death during the first months of Alexander’s reign.</p>

different language not long afterwards, near the time when Alexander
crossed into Asia (Arrian, ii. 14, 11). The first letter must have
been sent shortly after Philip’s death, when Darius was publicly
boasting of having procured the deed, and before he had yet learnt to
fear Alexander. Compare Diodor. xvii. 7.</p>

We may be sure that the presence of the Macedonian garrison was
connected with the predominance in the city of a party favorable to
Macedonia. In the ensuing year, when the resistance really occurred,
this was done by the anti-Macedonian party, who then got back from
exile.</p>

<p>The decree, naming Demosthenes among the envoys, is likely
enough to have been passed chiefly by the votes of his enemies. It
was always open to an Athenian citizen to accept or decline such an
appointment.</p>

<p>Arrian speaks as if this request had been addressed only to the
Greeks <i>within</i> Peloponnesus; moreover he mentions no assembly at
Corinth, which is noticed (though with some confusion) by Diodorus,
Justin, and Plutarch. Cities out of Peloponnesus, as well as within
it, must have been included; unless we suppose that the resolution of
the Amphiktyonic assembly, which had been previously passed, was held
to comprehend all the extra-Peloponnesian cities, which seems not
probable.</p>

Böhnecke, in his instructive comments on this convention (Forschungen

prohibition here mentioned as if it were one specially binding the
Macedonians not to sail with armed ships into the Peiræus. This
undoubtedly is the particular case on which the orator insists; but
I conceive it to have been only a particular case under a general
prohibitory rule.</p>

<p>The persons designated by οἱ δὲ, and denounced throughout this
oration generally, are, Alexander or the Macedonian officers and
soldiers.</p>

<p>A passage in Deinarchus cont. Demosth. p. 14, leads to the
supposition, that a standing Macedonian force was kept at Corinth,
occupying the Isthmus. The Thebans, however, declared against
Macedonia (in August or September 335 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
and proceeding to besiege the Macedonian garrison in the Kadmeia,
sent envoys to entreat aid from the Arcadians. “These envoys (says
Deinarchus) got with difficulty by sea to the Arcadians”—οἳ κατὰ
θάλασσαν <span class="gesperrt">μόλις</span> ἀφίκοντο πρὸς ἐκείνους.
Whence should this difficulty arise, except from a Macedonian
occupation of Corinth?</p>

href="#FNanchor_39">[39]</a></span> Arrian, i. 16, 10. παρὰ τὰ κοινῇ

that the Grecian mercenaries who had been serving with that prince,
were highly criminal for having contravened the general vote of the
Greeks (παρὰ τὰ δόγματα τὰ Ἑλλήνων), except such as had taken service
before that vote was passed, and except the Sinopeans, whom Alexander
considered as subjects of Persia and not partakers τοῦ κοινοῦ τῶν
Ἑλλήνων (Arrian, iii. 23, 15; iii. 24, 8, 9).</p>

<p id="Footnote_40"><span class="label"><a

Though standing among the Demosthenic works, it is supposed by
Libanius as well as by most modern critics not to be the production
of Demosthenes—upon internal grounds of style, which are certainly
forcible. Libanius says that it bears much resemblance to the style
of Hyperides. At any rate, there seems no reason to doubt that it is
a genuine oration of one of the contemporary orators. I agree with
Böhnecke (Forschungen, p. 629) in thinking that it must have been
delivered a few months after the convention with Alexander, before
the taking of Thebes.</p>

<p>The orator argues (p. 213) that the Macedonians had recognized
despotism as contrary to the convention, in so far as to expel the
despots from the towns of Antissa and Eresus in Lesbos. But probably
these despots were in correspondence with the Persians on the

to and up the Danube from Byzantium (Arrian, i. 3, 3), to meet him
after his march by land from the southern coast of Thrace. It is not
improbable that the Athenian vessels detained may have come loaded
with a supply of corn, and that the detention of the corn-ships may
have been intended to facilitate this operation.</p>

<p id="Footnote_61"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_61">[61]</a></span> Neither the point where Alexander
crossed the Danube,—nor the situation of the island called Peukê,—nor
the identity of the river Lyginus—nor the part of Mount Hæmus which
Alexander forced his way over—can be determined. The data given by
Arrian are too brief and too meagre to make out with assurance any
part of his march after he crossed the Nestus. The facts reported by
the historian represent only a small portion of what Alexander really
did in this expedition.</p>

<p>It seems clear, however, that the main purpose of Alexander
was to attack and humble the Triballi. Their locality is known
generally as the region where the modern Servia joins Bulgaria.
They reached eastward (in the times of Thucydides, ii. 96) as far
as the river Oskius or Isker, which crosses the chain of Hæmus from
south to north, passes by the modern city of Sophia, and falls into
the Danube. Now Alexander, in order to conduct his army from the
eastern bank of the river Nestus, near its mouth, to the country of
the Triballi, would naturally pass through Philippopolis, which city
appears to have been founded by his father Philip, and therefore
probably had a regular road of communication to the maritime regions.
(See Stephanus Byz. v. Φιλιππόπολις.) Alexander would cross Mount
Hæmus, then, somewhere north-west of Philippopolis. We read in the
year 376 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (Diodor. xv. 36) of an invasion of
Abdêra by the Triballi; which shows that there was a road, not unfit
for an army, from their territory to the eastern side of the mouth
of the river Nestus, where Abdêra was situated. This was the road
which Alexander is likely to have followed. But he must probably have
made a considerable circuit to the eastward; for the route which Paul
Lucas describes himself as having taken direct from Philippopolis to
Drama, can hardly have been fit for an army.</p>

<p>The river Lyginus may perhaps be the modern Isker, but this
is not certain. The Island called Peukê is still more perplexing.
Strabo speaks of it as if it were near the mouth of the Danube
(vii. p. 301-305). But it seems impossible that either the range of
the Triballi, or the march of Alexander, can have extended so far
eastward. Since Strabo (as well as Arrian) copied Alexander’s march
from Ptolemy, whose authority is very good, we are compelled to
suppose that there was a second island called Peukê higher up the
river.</p>

<p>The Geography of Thrace is so little known, that we cannot wonder
at our inability to identify these places. We are acquainted, and
that but imperfectly, with the two high roads, both starting from
Byzantium or Constantinople. 1. The one (called the King’s Road, from
having been in part the march of Xerxes in his invasion of Greece,
Livy, xxxix. 27; Herodot. vii. 115) crossing the Hebrus and the
Nestus, touching the northern coast of the Ægean Sea at Neapolis, a
little south of Philippi, then crossing the Strymon at Amphipolis,
and stretching through Pella across Inner Macedonia and Illyria to
Dyrrachium (the Via Egnatia). 2. The other, taking a more northerly
course, passing along the upper valley of the Hebrus from Adrianople
to Philippopolis, then through Sardicia (Sophia) and Naissus (Nisch),
to the Danube near Belgrade; being the high road now followed from
Constantinople to Belgrade.</p>

<p>But apart from these two roads, scarcely anything whatever is
known of the country. Especially the mountainous region of Rhodopê,
bounded on the west by the Strymon, on the north and east by the
Hebrus, and on the south by the Ægean, is a Terra Incognita, except
the few Grecian colonies on the coast. Very few travellers have
passed along, or described the southern or King’s Road, while the
region in the interior, apart from the high road, was absolutely
unexplored until the visit of M. Viquesnel in 1847, under scientific
mission from the French government. The brief, but interesting
account, composed by M. Viquesnel, of this rugged and impracticable
district, is contained in the “Archives des Missions Scientifiques
et Litteraires”, for 1850, published at Paris. Unfortunately, the
map intended to accompany that account has not yet been prepared;
but the published data, as far as they go, have been employed by
Kiepert in constructing his recent map of Turkey in Europe; the best
map of these regions now existing, though still very imperfect.
The Illustrations (Erläuterungen) annexed by Kiepert to his map of
Turkey, show the defective data on which the chartography of this
country is founded. Until the survey of M. Viquesnel, the higher
part of the course of the Strymon, and nearly all the course of the
Nestus, may be said to have been wholly unknown.</p>

in the Territory of the Triballi, the modern Servia, he would in this
march follow mainly the road which is now frequented between Belgrade
and Bitolia; through the plain of Kossovo, Pristina, Katschanik
(rounding on the north-eastern side the Ljubatrin, the north-eastern
promontory terminating the chain of Skardus), Uschkub, Kuprili, along
the higher course of the Axius or Vardar, until the point where the
Erigon or Tscherna joins that river below Kuprili. Here he would be
among the Pæonians and Agrianes, on the east—and the Dardani and
Autariatæ, seemingly on the north and west. If he then followed the
course of the Erigon, he would pass through the portions of Macedonia
then called Deuripia and Pelagonia: he would go between the ridges of
the mountains, through which the Erigon breaks, called Nidje on the
south, and Babuna on the north. He would pass afterwards to Florina,
and not to Bitolia.</p>

in his orations frequently insists on the different rank and position
of Athens, as compared with those of the smaller Grecian states—and
of the higher and more arduous obligations consequent thereupon. This
is one grand point of distinction between his policy and that of
Phokion. See a striking passage in the speech De Coronâ, p. 245. s.
77; and Orat. De Republ. Ordinand. p. 176. s. 37.</p>

<p>Isokrates holds the same language touching the obligations of
Sparta,—in the speech which he puts into the mouth of Archidamus.
“No one will quarrel with Epidaurians and Phliasians, for looking
only how they can get through and keep themselves in being. But for
Lacedæmonians, it is impossible to aim simply at preservation and
nothing beyond—by any means, whatever they may be. If we cannot
preserve ourselves with honor, we ought to prefer a glorious death.”
(Isokrates, Orat. vi. Archid. s. 106.)</p>

<p>The backward and narrow policy, which Isokrates here proclaims as
fit for Epidaurus and Phlius, but not for Sparta—is precisely what
Phokion always recommended for Athens, even while Philip’s power was
yet nascent and unsettled.</p>

represented by Ptolemy, from whom Arrian copies (i. 8, 1), not
only as being the first and only attack made by the Macedonian
army on Thebes, but also as made by Perdikkas <i>without orders from
Alexander</i>, who was forced to support it in order to preserve
Perdikkas from being overwhelmed by the Thebans. According to Ptolemy
and Arrian, therefore, the storming of Thebes took place both without
the orders, and against the wishes, of Alexander; the capture
moreover was effected rapidly with little trouble to the besieging
army (ἡ ἅλωσις δι᾽ ὀλίγου τε καὶ <span class="gesperrt">οὐ ξὺν πόνῳ
τῶν ἑλόντων</span> ξυνενεχθεῖσα, Arr. i. 9, 9): the bloodshed and
pillage was committed by the vindictive sentiment of the Bœotian
allies.</p>

<p>Diodorus had before him a very different account. He affirms that
Alexander both combined and ordered the assault—that the Thebans
behaved like bold and desperate men, resisting obstinately and for
a long time—that the slaughter afterwards was committed by the
general body of the assailants; the Bœotian allies being doubtless
conspicuous among them. Diodorus gives this account at some length,
and with his customary rhetorical amplifications. Plutarch and Justin
are more brief; but coincide in the same general view, and not in
that of Arrian. Polyænus again (iv. 3 12) gives something different
from all.</p>

<p>To me it appears that the narrative of Diodorus is (in its basis,
and striking off rhetorical amplifications) more credible than that
of Arrian. Admitting the attack made by Perdikkas, I conceive it to
have been a portion of the general plan of Alexander. I cannot think
it probable that Perdikkas attacked without orders, or that Thebes
was captured with little resistance. It was captured by <i>one</i> assault
(Æschines adv. Ktesiph. p. 524), but by an assault well-combined and
stoutly contested—not by one begun without preparation or order,
and successful after hardly any resistance. Alexander, after having
offered what he thought liberal terms, was not the man to shrink
from carrying his point by force; nor would the Thebans have refused
those terms, unless their minds had been made up for strenuous and
desperate defence, without hope of ultimate success.</p>

<p>What authority Diodorus followed, we do not know. He may have
followed Kleitarchus, a contemporary and an Æolian, who must have had
good means of information respecting such an event as the capture
of Thebes (see Geier, Alexandri M. Historiarum Scriptores ætate
suppares, Leips. 1844, p. 6-152; and Vossius, De Historicis Græcis.
i. x. p. 90, ed. Westermann). I have due respect for the authority
of Ptolemy, but I cannot go along with Geier and other critics
who set aside all other witnesses, even contemporary, respecting
Alexander, as worthy of little credit, unless where such witnesses
are confirmed by Ptolemy or Aristobulus. We must remember that
Ptolemy did not compose his book until after he became king of Egypt,
in 306 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; nor indeed until after the battle
of Ipsus in 301, according to Geier (p. 1); at least twenty-nine
years after the sack of Thebes. Moreover, Ptolemy was not ashamed
of what Geier calls (p. 11) the “pious fraud” of announcing, that
two speaking serpents conducted the army of Alexander to the holy
precinct of Zeus Ammon (Arrian, iii. 3). Lastly, it will be found
that the depositions which are found in other historians, but not in
Ptolemy and Aristobulus, relate principally to matters discreditable
to Alexander. That Ptolemy and Aristobulus <i>omitted</i>, is in my
judgment far more probable, than that other historians <i>invented</i>.
Admiring biographers would easily excuse themselves for refusing to
proclaim to the world such acts as the massacre of the Branchidæ, or
the dragging of the wounded Batiz at Gaza.</p>

points analogous to those of the Hellênes:—</p>

<p>“Human sacrifices were certainly offered in the city of Saugor
during the whole Mahratta government, up to the year 1800—when they
were put a stop to by the local governor, Assa Sahib, a very humane
man. I once heard a learned Brahmin priest say, that he thought
the decline of his (Assa Sahib’s) family and government arose from
this innovation. ‘There is (said he) no sin in not offering human
sacrifices to the gods, where none have been offered; <i>but where the
gods have been accustomed to them, they are very naturally annoyed
when the rite is abolished, and visit the place and the people with
all kinds of calamity</i>.’ The priest did not seem to think that there
was anything singular in this mode of reasoning: perhaps three
Brahmin priests out of four would have reasoned in the same manner.”

<p>Arrian states that the visit of Demades with nine other Athenian
envoys to Alexander, occurred <i>prior</i> to the demand of Alexander
for the extradition of the ten citizens. He (Arrian) affirms that
immediately on hearing the capture of Thebes, the Athenians passed a
vote, on the motion of Demades, to send ten envoys, for the purpose
of expressing satisfaction that Alexander had come home safely from
the Illyrians, and that he had punished the Thebans for their revolt.
Alexander (according to Arrian) received this mission courteously,
but replied by sending a letter to the Athenian people, insisting on
the surrender of the ten citizens.</p>

<p>Now both Diodorus and Plutarch represent the mission of Demades
as <i>posterior</i> to the demand made by Alexander for the ten citizens;
and that it was intended to meet and deprecate that demand.</p>

<p>In my judgment, Arrian’s tale is the less credible of the two. I
think it highly improbable that the Athenians would by public vote
express satisfaction that Alexander had punished the Thebans for
their revolt. If the macedonizing party at Athens was strong enough
to carry so ignominious a vote, they would also have been strong
enough to carry the subsequent proposition of Phokion—that the ten
citizens demanded should be surrendered. The fact, that the Athenians
afforded willing shelter to the Theban fugitives, is a farther reason
for disbelieving this alleged vote.</p>

<p>Toward the end of October 1812, near Moscow, General
Winzingerode, a German officer in the Russian service,—with his
aide-de-camp a native Russian, Narishkin,—became prisoner of the
French. He was brought to Napoleon—“At the sight of that German
general, all the secret resentments of Napoleon took fire. ‘Who are
you (he exclaimed)? a man without a country! When I was at war with
the Austrians, I found you in their ranks. Austria has become my
ally, and you have entered into the Russian service. You have been
one of the warmest instigators of the present war. Nevertheless, you
are a native of the Confederation of the Rhine: <i>you are my subject</i>.
You are not an ordinary enemy: you are a rebel: I have a right to
bring you to trial. <i>Gens d’armes</i>, seize this man!’ Then addressing
the aide-de-camp of Winzingerode, Napoleon said, ‘As for you, Count
Narishkin, I have nothing to reproach you with: you are a Russian,
you are doing your duty.’” (Ségur’s account of the Campaign in
Russia, book ix. ch. vi. p. 132.)</p>

<p>Napoleon did not realize these threats against Winzingerode; but
his language expresses just the same sentiment as that of Alexander
towards the captive Greeks.</p>

<p>Since we know from Demosthenes that the pezetæri date from the

ἑταῖροι, in reference to the kings of Macedonia, first appears in
Plutarch, Pelopidas, 27, in reference to Ptolemy, before the time
of Philip; see Otto Abel, Makedonien vor König Philip, p. 129 (the
passage of Ælian referred to by him seems of little moment). The term
Companions or Comrades had under Philip a meaning purely military,
designating foreigners as well as Macedonians serving in his army:
see Theopompus, Frag. 249. The term, originally applied only to a
select few, was by degrees extended to the corps generally.</p>

<p>Curtius, viii. 6. 1. “Mos erat principibus Macedonum adultos
liberos regibus tradere, ad munia haud multum servilibus ministeriis
abhorrentia. Excubabant servatis noctium vicibus proximi foribus
ejus ædis, in quâ rex aquiescebat. Per hos pellices introducebantur,
alio aditu quam quem armati obsidebant. Iidem acceptos ab agasonibus
equos, quum rex ascensurus esset, admovebant; comitabanturque et
venantem, et in præliis, omnibus artibus studiorum liberalium
exculti. Præcipuus honor habebatur, quod licebat sedentibus vesci
cum rege. Castigandi eos verberibus nullius potestas præter ipsum
erat. Hæc cohors velut seminarium ducum præfectorumque apud Macedonas
fuit: hinc habuere posteri reges, quorum stirpibus post multas ætates
Romani opes ademerunt.” Compare Curtius, v. 6, 42; and Ælian, V. H.
xiv. 49.</p>

<p>This information is interesting, as an illustration of Macedonian
manners and customs, which are very little known to us. In the last
hours of the Macedonian monarchy, after the defeat at Pydna (168
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the <i>pueri regii</i> followed the defeated
king Perseus to the sanctuary at Samothrace, and never quitted him
until the moment when he surrendered himself to the Romans (Livy,
xlv. 5).</p>

<p>As an illustration of the scourging, applied as a punishment to
these young Macedonians of rank, see the case of Dekamnichus, handed
over by king Archelaus to Euripides, to be flogged (Aristotle, Polit.
v. 8, 13).</p>

interfecit. Sed nec suis, qui apti regno videbantur, pepercit; ne qua

also xii. 6, where the Pausanias mentioned as having been put to
death by Alexander is not the assassin of Philip. Pausanias was a
common Macedonian name (see Diodor. xvi. 93).</p>

<p>I see no reason for distrusting the general fact here asserted by
Justin. We know from Arrian (who mentioned the fact incidentally in
his work τὰ μετὰ Ἀλέξανδρον, though he says nothing about it in his
account of the expedition of Alexander—see Photius, Cod. 92. p. 220)
that Alexander put to death, in the early period of his reign, his
first cousin and brother-in-law Amyntas. Much less would he scruple
to kill the friends or relatives of Kleopatra. Neither Alexander
nor Antipater would account such proceeding anything else than a
reasonable measure of prudential policy. By the Macedonian common
law, when a man was found guilty of treason, all his relatives were
condemned to die along with him (Curtius, vi. 11, 20).</p>

<p>Plutarch (De Fortunâ Alex. Magn. p. 342) has a general allusion
to these precautionary executions ordered by Alexander. Fortune
(he says) imposed upon Alexander δεινὴν πρὸς ἄνδρας ὁμοφύλους

<p>Dikæarchus (Fragm. 19, ed. Didot. ap. Athenæum, xiii. p. 603)

others before him; by Xerxes (Herodot. vii. 43), who offered up
1000 oxen—by Mindarus (Xenoph. Hellen. i. 1, 4), etc. In describing
the proceedings of Alexander at Ilium, Dikæarchus appears he have
dwelt much on the warm sympathy which that prince exhibited for the
affection between Achilles and Patroklus: which sympathy Dikæarchus
illustrated by characterizing Alexander as φιλόπαις ἐκμανῶς, and
by recounting his public admiration for the eunuch Bagôas: compare
Curtius, x. i. 25—about Bagôas.</p>

(Alexand. 15) says that the highest numbers which he had read of,
were,—43,000 infantry with 5000 cavalry: the lowest numbers, 30,000
infantry with 4000 cavalry (assuming the correction of Sintenis,
τετρακισχιλίους in place of πεντακισχιλίους, to be well founded, as
it probably is—compare Plutarch, Fort. Alex. M. i. p. 327).</p>

<p>According to Plutarch (Fort. Al. M. p. 327), both Ptolemy and
Aristobulus stated the number of infantry to be 30,000; but Ptolemy
gave the cavalry as 5000, Aristobulus, as only 4000. Nevertheless,
Arrian—who professes to follow mainly Ptolemy and Aristobulus,
whenever they agree—states the number of infantry as “not much more
than 30,000; the cavalry as more than 5000” (Exp. Al. i. 11, 4).
Anaximenes alleged 43,000 infantry, with 5500 cavalry. Kallisthenes
(ap. Polybium. xii. 19) stated 40,000 infantry, with 4500 cavalry.
Justin (xi. 6) gives 32,000 infantry, with 4500 cavalry.</p>

<p>My statement in the text follows Diodorus, who stands
distinguished, by recounting not merely the total, but the component
items besides. In regard to the total of infantry, he agrees with
Ptolemy and Aristobulus: as to cavalry, his statement is a mean
between the two.</p>

by Memnon, as set forth in Arrian (i. 12, 16), and in Diodorus (xvii.
18). The superiority of Diodorus is here incontestable. He proclaims
distinctly both the defensive and the offensive side of Memnon’s
policy; which, when taken together, form a scheme of operations no
less effective than prudent. But Arrian omits all notice of the
offensive policy, and mentions only the defensive—the retreat and
destruction of the country; which, if adopted alone, could hardly
have been reckoned upon for success, in starving out Alexander, and
might reasonably be called in question by the Persian generals.
Moreover, we should form but a poor idea of Memnon’s ability, if in
this emergency he neglected to avail himself of the irresistible
Persian fleet.</p>

<p>I notice the rather this point of superiority of Diodorus,
because recent critics have manifested a tendency to place too
exclusive a confidence in Arrian, and to discredit almost all
allegations respecting Alexander except such as Arrian either
certifies or countenances. Arrian is a very valuable historian; he
has the merit of giving us plain narrative without rhetoric, which
contrasts favorably both with Diodorus and with Curtius; but he must
not be set up as the only trustworthy witness.</p>

<p>Apparently, this passage λοξὴν ἀεὶ παρατείνων τὴν τάξιν, ᾗ

describing the purpose to be accomplished.</p>

<p>I cannot think that the words imply a movement <i>in échelon</i>, as

<p>These words deserve attention, because they show how incomplete
Arrian’s description of the battle had before been. Dwelling almost
exclusively upon the personal presence and achievements of Alexander,
he had said little even about the right half of the army, and nothing
at all about the left half of it under Parmenio. We discover from
these words that <i>all</i> the τάξεις of the phalanx (not only the three
in Alexander’s half, but also the three in Parmenio’s half) passed
the river nearly at the same time, and for the most part, with little
or no resistance.</p>

<p id="Footnote_225"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_225">[225]</a></span> The last desperate struggle
of the besieged, is what stands described in i. 22 of Arrian, and
in xvii. 26, 27 of Diodorus; though the two descriptions are very
different. Arrian does not name Ephialtes at Halikarnassus. He
follows the Macedonian authors, Ptolemy and Aristobulus; who probably
dwelt only on Memnon and the Persians as their real enemies, treating
the Greeks in general as a portion of the hostile force. On the
other hand, Diodorus and Curtius appear to have followed, in great
part, Grecian authors; in whose view eminent Athenian exiles, like
Ephialtes and Charidemus, counted for much more.</p>

<p>The fact here mentioned by Diodorus, that Ephialtes drove
back the young Macedonian guard, and that the battle was restored
only by the extraordinary efforts of the old guard—is one of much
interest, which I see no reason for mistrusting, though Arrian says
nothing about it. Curtius (v. 2; viii. 1) makes allusion to it on
a subsequent occasion, naming Atharrias: the part of his work in
which it ought to have been narrated, is lost. On this, as on other
occasions, Arrian slurs over the partial reverses, obstructions, and
losses, of Alexander’s career. His authorities probably did so before
him.</p>

Ibrahim Pacha, the Turkish commander left the westernmost pass
undefended, so that Ibrahim Pacha passed from Tarsus along it without
opposition. The Turkish troops occupied the easternmost pass, but
defended themselves badly, so that the passage was forced by the
Egyptians (Histoire de la Guerre de Mehemed Ali, par Cadalvène et

time by a distance, not less than eight days of ordinary march. If

<span class="gesperrt">ἐπὶ φάλαγγος ἁπλῆς</span> ἐδέχετο τὸ χωρίον,
ἵνα ἐτάσσοντο.</p>

<p>The depth of this single phalanx is not given, nor do we know
the exact width of the ground which it occupied. Assuming a depth
of sixteen, and one pace in breadth to each soldier, 4000 men would
stand in the breadth of a stadium of 250 paces; and therefore 80,000
men in a breadth of twenty stadia (see the calculation of Rüstow
and Köchly, p. 280, about the Macedonian line). Assuming a depth of
twenty-six, 6500 men would stand in the stadium, and therefore 90,000
in a total breadth of 14 stadia, which is that given by Kallisthenes.
But there must have been intervals left, greater or less, we know not
how many; the covering detachments, which had been thrown out before
the river Pinarus, must have found some means of passing through to
the rear, when recalled.</p>

<p>Mr. Kinneir states that the breadth between Mount Amanus and the
sea varies between one mile and a half (English) and three miles. The
fourteen stadia of Kallisthenes are equivalent to nearly one English
mile and three-quarters.</p>

<p>Neither in ancient nor in modern times have Oriental armies ever
been trained, by native officers, to regularity of march or array—see
Malcolm, Hist. of Persia, ch. xxiii. vol. ii. p. 498; Volney, Travels
in Egypt and Syria, vol. i. p. 124.</p>

appears to have reckoned the mercenaries composing the Persian
phalanx at 30,000—and the cavalry at 30,000. He does not seem to have
taken account of the Kardakes. Yet Polybius in his criticism tries to
make out that there was not room for an array of even 60,000; while
Arrian enumerates 90,000 hoplites, not including cavalry (Polyb. xii.
18).</p>

<p id="Footnote_277"><span class="label"><a

the ease with which Alexander drove them back—a material point in
reference to the battle—are noticed by Curtius, iii. 9, 11.</p>

<p id="Footnote_278"><span class="label"><a

εἶχεν ἐπὶ τοῦ ἅρματος, ξὺν τοῖς πρώτοις ἔφευγε, etc.</p>

<p>This simple statement of Arrian is far more credible than the
highly wrought details given by Diodorus (xvii. 34) and Curtius
(iii. 11, 9) about a direct charge of Alexander upon the chariot of
Darius, and a murderous combat immediately round that chariot, in
which the horses became wounded and unmanageable, so as to be on the
point of overturning it. Chares even went so far as to affirm that
Alexander had come into personal conflict with Darius, from whom he
had received his wound in the thigh (Plutarch, Alex. 20). Plutarch
had seen the letter addressed by Alexander to Antipater, simply
intimating that he had received a slight wound in the thigh.</p>

<p>In respect to this point, as to so many others, Diodorus and
Curtius have copied the same authority.</p>

<p>Kallisthenes (ap. Polyb. xii. 22) stated that Alexander had laid
his plan of attack with a view to bear upon the person of Darius,
which is not improbable (compare Xenoph. Anab. i. 8, 22), and was in
fact realized, since the first successful charge of the Macedonians
came so near to Darius as to alarm him for the safety of his own
person. To the question put by Polybius—How did Alexander know in
what part of the army Darius was?—we may reply, that the chariot and
person of Darius would doubtless be conspicuous: moreover the Persian
kings were habitually in the centre—and Cyrus the younger, at the
battle of Kunaxa, directed the attack to be made exactly against the
person of his brother Artaxerxes.</p>

<p>After the battle of Kunaxa, Artaxerxes assumed to himself the
honor of having slain Cyrus with his own hand, and put to death those
who had really done the deed, because they boasted of it (Plutarch,
Artax. 16).</p>

southward of Myriandrus towards the sea. [See Mr. Ainsworth’s Essay
on the Cilician and Syrian Gates, Journal of the Geograph. Society,
1838, p. 194]. These Greeks, being merely fugitives with arms in
their hands—with neither cavalry nor baggage—could make their way
over very difficult ground.</p>

iii. 11, 13. Kallisthenes stated the same thing as Arrian—that this
Persian cavalry had crossed the Pinarus, and charged the Thessalians
with bravery. Polybius censures him for it, as if he had affirmed
something false and absurd (xii. 18). This shows that the criticisms
of Polybius are not to be accepted without reserve. He reasons as if
the Macedonian phalanx <i>could</i> not cross the Pinarus—converting a
difficulty into an impossibility (xii. 22).</p>

Hegesias by Dionysius of Halikarnassus, as an example of bad rhythm
and taste, has the merit of bringing out the details respecting the
person of Batis, which were well calculated to disgust and aggravate
the wrath of Alexander. The bad taste of Hegesias as a writer does
not diminish his credibility as a witness.</p>

<p id="Footnote_366"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_366">[366]</a></span> The praise bestowed upon the
continence of Alexander, for refusing to visit Statira the wife of
Darius, is exaggerated even to absurdity.</p>

<p>In regard to women, Alexander was by temperament cold, the
opposite of his father Philip. During his youth, his development was
so tardy, that there was even a surmise of some physical disability
(Hieronymus ap. Athenæ. x. p. 435). As to the most beautiful persons,
of both sexes, he had only to refuse the numerous tenders made to him
by those who sought to gain his favor (Plutarch, Alex. 22). Moreover,
after the capture of Damascus, he did select for himself, from among
the female captives, Barsinê, the widow of his illustrious rival
Memnon; daughter of Artabazus, a beautiful woman of engaging manners,
and above all, distinguished, by having received Hellenic education,
from the simply Oriental harem of Darius (Plutarch, Alex. 21). In
adopting the widow of Memnon as his mistress, Alexander may probably
have had present to his imagination the example of his legendary
ancestor Neoptolemus, whose tender relations with Andromache,
widow of his enemy Hektor, would not be forgotten by any reader of
Euripides. Alexander had by Barsinê a son called Herakles.</p>

<p>Lastly, Alexander was so absorbed by ambition,—so overcharged
with the duties and difficulties of command, which he always
performed himself—and so continually engaged in fatiguing bodily
effort,—that he had little leisure left for indulgences; such leisure
as he had, he preferred devoting to wine-parties with the society and
conversation of his officers.</p>

<p>Curtius and Justin mention a third embassy sent by Darius

of Statira) to Alexander, asking for peace. The other authors allude
only to two tentatives of this kind; and the third seems by no means
probable.</p>

that it was so set down in the official scheme of the battle,
drawn up by the Persian officers, and afterwards captured with the
baggage of Darius. Though thus authentic as far as it goes, it is
not complete, even as to names—while it says nothing about numbers
or depth or extent of front. Several names, of various contingents
stated to have been present in the field, are not placed in the
official return—thus the Sogdiani, the Arians, and the Indian
mountaineers are mentioned by Arrian as having joined Darius (iii.
8); the Kossæans, by Diodorus (xvii. 59); the Sogdiani, Massagetæ,
Belitæ, Kossæans, Gortyæ, Phrygians, and Kataonians, by Curtius (iv.

expressly mentioned by Arrian that the baggage, etc. was brought
forward from the first camp to the second. But we see that such must
have been the fact, from what happened during the battle. Alexander’s
baggage, which was plundered by a body of Persian cavalry, cannot
have been so far in the rear of the army as the distance of the first
camp would require. This coincides also with Curtius, iv. 13, 35. The
words ἔγνω ἀπολείπειν (Arrian, iii. 9, 2), indicate the contemplation
of a purpose which was not accomplished—ὡς ἅμ᾽ ἡμέρᾳ προσμῖξαι τοῖς
πολεμίοις (iii. 9, 3). Instead of “coming into conflict” with the
enemy at break of day—Alexander only arrived within sight of them at
break of day; he then halted the whole day and night within sight
of their position; and naturally brought up his baggage, having no
motive to leave it so far in the rear.</p>

<p>Arrian mentions distinctly only those chariots which were
launched on Darius’s left, immediately opposite to Alexander. But it
is plain that the chariots along the whole line must have been let
off at one and the same signal—which we may understand as implied in
the words of Curtius—“Ipse (Darius) ante se falcatos currus habebat,
quos signo dato universos in hostem effudit” (iv. 14, 3).</p>

<p>The scythed chariots of Artaxerxes, at the battle of Kunaxa, did
no mischief (Xenoph. Anab. i. 8, 10-20). At the battle of Magnesia,
gained by the Romans (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 190) over the Syrian
king Antiochus, his chariots were not only driven back, but spread
disorder among their own troops (Appian, Reb. Syriac. 33).</p>

the first” (ii. 11, 6); at Arbela here, he states that “Darius was
the first to turn and flee;” an expression yet stronger and more
distinct. Curtius and Diodorus, who seem here as elsewhere to follow
generally the same authorities, give details, respecting the conduct
of Darius, which are not to be reconciled with Arrian, and which are
decidedly less credible than Arrian’s narrative. The fact that the
two kings were here (as at Issus) near, and probably visible, to
each other, has served as a basis for much embroidery. The statement
that Darius, standing on his chariot, hurled his spear against the
advancing Macedonians—and that Alexander also hurled his spear at
Darius, but missing him, killed the charioteer—is picturesque and
Homeric, but has no air of reality. Curtius and Diodorus tell us
that this fall of the charioteer was mistaken for the fall of the
king, and struck the Persian army with consternation, causing them
forthwith to take flight, and thus ultimately forcing Darius to flee
also (Diodor. xvii. 60; Curt. iv. 15, 26-32). But this is noway
probable; since the real fight then going on was close, and with
hand-weapons.</p>

is plain that what he says must be understood of the τάξις commanded
by Kraterus also. Of the six τάξεις or divisions of the phalanx, that
of Kraterus stood at the extreme left—that of Simmias (who commanded
on this day the τάξις of Amyntas son of Andromenes) next to it
(iii. 11, 16). If therefore the τάξις of Simmias was kept back from
pursuit, on account of the pressure upon the general Macedonian left
(iii. 14, 6)—<i>à fortiori</i>, the τάξις of Kraterus must have been kept
back in like manner.</p>

<p>One among the changes now made was, that the divisions of

<p>The Persian Susa was situated between two rivers; the Choaspes
(now Kherkha) on the west; the Eulæus or Pasitigris, now Karun, on
the east; both rivers distinguished for excellent water. The Eulæus
appears to have been called Pasitigris in the lower part of its

Similar habits have always prevailed among Orientals. “The most
atrocious part of the Mohammedan system of punishment, is, that which
regards theft and robbery. Mutilation, by cutting off the hand or the
foot, is the prescribed remedy for all higher degrees of the offence”
(Mill, History of British India, book iii. ch. 5. p. 447).</p>

<p>“Tippoo Saib used to cut off the right hands and noses of the
British camp-followers that fell into his hands” (Elphinstone, Hist.
of India, vol. i. p. 380. ch. xi.).</p>

as well as male, who are to be seen in the northern part of Scinde

5; Justin, xi. 14. Arrian does not mention these mutilated captives;
but I see no reason to mistrust the deposition of the three authors
by whom it is certified. Curtius talks of 4000 captives; the other
two mention 800. Diodorus calls them —Ἕλληνες ὑπὸ τῶν πρότερον
βασιλέων ἀνάστατοι γεγονότες, ὀκτακόσιοι μὲν σχεδὸν τὸν ἀριθμὸν
ὄντες, ταῖς δ᾽ ἡλικίαις οἱ πλεῖστοι μὲν γεγηρακότες, ἠκρωτηριασμένοι
δὲ πάντες, etc. Some ἀνάρπαστοι πρὸς βασιλέα διὰ σοφίαν are noticed
in Xenoph. Mem. iv. 2, 33; compare Herodot. iii. 93; iv. 204. I have
already mentioned the mutilation of the Macedonian invalids, taken at
Issus by Darius.</p>

<p>Probably these Greek captives were mingled with a number of
other captives, Asiatics and others, who had been treated in the
same manner. None but the Greek captives would be likely to show
themselves to Alexander and his army, because none but they would
calculate on obtaining sympathy from an army of Macedonians and
Greeks. It would have been interesting to know who these captives
were, or how they came to be thus cruelly used. The two persons among
them, named by Curtius as spokesmen in the interview with Alexander,
are—Euktemon, a Kymæan—and Theætêtus, an Athenian.</p>

Diodorus (xvii. 71) and by Curtius (v. 6, 9). We see however from
Strabo that there were different statements as to the amount. Such
overwhelming figures deserve no confidence upon any evidence short of
an official return. At the same time, we ought to expect a very great
sum, considering the long series of years that had been spent in
amassing it. Alexander’s own letters (Plutarch, Alex. 37) stated that
enough was carried away to load 10,000 mule carts and 5000 camels.
</p>

<p>To explain the fact, of a large accumulated treasure in the
Persian capitals, it must be remarked, that what we are accustomed
to consider as expenses of government, were not defrayed out of the
regal treasure. The military force, speaking generally, was not paid
by the Great King, but summoned by requisition from the provinces,
upon which the cost of maintaining the soldiers fell, over and above
the ordinary tribute. The king’s numerous servants and attendants
received no pay in money, but in kind; provisions for maintaining
the court with its retinue were furnished by the provinces, over
and above the tribute. See Herodot. i. 192; and iii. 91—and a good
passage of Heeren, setting forth the small public disbursement out of
the regal treasure, in his account of the internal constitution of
the ancient Persian Empire (Ideen über die Politik and den Verkehr
der Völker der alten Welt, part i. Abth. 1. p. 511-519).</p>

<p>Respecting modern Persia, Jaubert remarks (Voyage en Arménie et
en Perse, Paris, 1821, p. 272, ch. 30)—“Si les sommes que l’on verse
dans le trésor du Shah ne sont pas exorbitantes, comparativement à
l’étendue et à la population de la Perse, elles n’en sortent pas
non plus que pour des dépenses indispensables qui n’en absorbent
pas la moitié. Le reste est converti en lingots, en pierreries,
et en divers objets d’une grande valeur et d’un transport facile
en cas d’évènement: ce qui doit suffire pour empêcher qu’on ne
trouve exagérés les rapports que tous les voyageurs ont faits de la
magnificence de la cour de Perse. Les Perses sont assez clairvoyans
pour pénétrer les motifs réels qui portent Futteh Ali Shah à
thésauriser.”</p>

<p>When Nadir-Shah conquered the Mogul Emperor Mohammed, and entered
Delhi in 1739,—the imperial treasure and effects which fell into his
hands is said to have amounted to £32,000,000 sterling, besides heavy
contributions levied on the inhabitants (Mill, History of British
India, vol. ii, B. iii, ch. 4, p. 403).—Runjeet Sing left at his
death (1839) a treasure of £8,000,000 sterling: with jewels and other
effects to several millions more. [The Punjaub, by Col. Steinbach, p.
16. London, 1845].</p>

<p>Mr. Mill remarks in another place, that “in Hindostan, gold,
silver, and gems are most commonly hoarded, and not devoted to
production” (vol. i, p. 254, B. ii. ch. 5).</p>

<p>Herodotus (iii. 96) tells us that the gold and silver brought to
the Persian regal treasure was poured in a melted state into earthern
vessels; when it cooled, the earthern vessel was withdrawn, and the
solid metallic mass left standing; a portion of it was cut off when
occasion required for disbursements. This practice warrants the
supposition that a large portion of it was habitually accumulated,
and not expended.</p>

massacre and plunder in Persepolis, permitted to the soldiers
of Alexander. Arrian does not mention it; he mentions only the
deliberate resolution of Alexander to burn the palace or citadel,
out of revenge on the Persian name. And such feeling, assuming it to
exist, would also naturally dictate the general license to plunder
and massacre. Himself entertaining such vindictive feeling, and
regarding it as legitimate, Alexander would either presume it to
exist, or love to kindle it, in his soldiers; by whom indeed the
license to plunder would be sufficiently welcomed, with or without
any antecedent sentiment of vengeance.</p>

<p>The story (told by Diodorus, Curtius, and Plutarch, Alex. 38)
that Alexander, in the drunkenness of a banquet, was first instigated
by the courtesan Thais to set fire to the palace of Persepolis, and
accompanied her to begin the conflagration with his own hand—may
perhaps be so far true, that he really showed himself in the scene
and helped in the burning. But that his resolution to burn was
deliberately taken, and even maintained against the opposition of
esteemed officers, is established on the authority of Arrian.</p>

<p id="Footnote_438"><span class="label"><a

Gates appear to be those described by Morier, Fraser, and other
modern travellers, as the series of narrow valleys and defiles called
Ser-Desch, Sirdari, or Serdara Kahn,—on the southernmost of the two
roads which lead eastward from Teheran towards Damaghan, and thence
farther eastward towards Mesched and Herat. See the note of Mützel
in his edition of Curtius, v. 35, 2, p. 489; also Morier, Second
Journey through Persia, p. 363; Fraser’s Narrative of a Journey into
Khorasan, p. 291.</p>

<p>The long range of mountains, called by the ancients Taurus,
extends from Lesser Media and Armenia in an easterly direction along
the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. Its northern declivity,
covered by prodigious forests with valleys and plains of no great
breadth reaching to the Caspian, comprehends the moist and fertile
territories now denominated Ghilan and Mazanderan. The eastern
portion of Mazanderan was known in ancient times as Hyrkania, then
productive and populous; while the mountain range itself was occupied
by various rude and warlike tribes—Kadusii, Mardi, Tapyri, etc.
The mountain range, now called Elburz, includes among other lofty
eminences the very high peak of Demavend.</p>

<p>The road from Ekbatana to Baktra, along which both the flight
of Darius and the pursuit of Alexander lay, passed along the broken
ground skirting the southern flank of the mountain range Elburz.
Of this broken ground the Caspian Gates formed the worst and most
difficult portion.</p>

and Dr. Thirlwall identify Susia with the town now called Tûs or
Toos, a few miles north-west of Mesched. Professor Wilson (Ariana
Antiqua, p. 177) thinks that this is too much to the west, and too
far from Herat: he conceives Susia to be Zuzan, on the desert side
of the mountains west of Herat. Mr. Prinsep (notes on the historical
results deducible from discoveries in Afghanistan, p. 14) places it
at Subzawar, south of Herat, and within the region of fertility.</p>

<p>Tûs seems to lie in the line of Alexander’s march, more than
the other two places indicated; Subzawar is too far to the south.
Alexander appears to have first directed his march from Parthia to
Baktria (in the line from Asterabad to Baikh through Margiana),
merely touching the borders of Aria in his route.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_472"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_472">[472]</a></span> Curtius, vii. 2, 27. The
proceedings respecting Philotas and Parmenio are recounted in
the greatest detail by Curtius; but his details are in general
harmony with the brief heads given by Arrian from Ptolemy and
Aristobulus—except as to one material point. Plutarch (Alex. 49),
Diodorus (xvii. 79, 80), and Justin (xii. 5), also state the fact in
the same manner.</p>

<p>Ptolemy and Aristobulus, according to the narrative of Arrian,
appear to have considered that Philotas was really implicated in a
conspiracy against Alexander’s life. But when we analyze what they
are reported to have said, their opinion will not be found entitled
to much weight. In the first place, they state (Arrian, iii. 26,
1) that the <i>conspiracy of Philotas had been before made known to
Alexander while he was in Egypt</i>, but that he did not then believe
it. Now eighteen months had elapsed since the stay in Egypt; and the
idea of a conspiracy going on for eighteen months is preposterous.
That Philotas was in a mood in which he might be supposed likely
to conspire, is one proposition; that he actually did conspire is
another; Arrian and his authorities run the two together as if they
were one. As to the evidence purporting to prove that Philotas did
conspire, Arrian tells us that “the informers came forward before
the assembled soldiers and convicted Philotas with the rest by other
<i>indicia</i> not obscure, <i>but chiefly by this</i>—that Philotas confessed
to have heard of a conspiracy going on, without mentioning it to
Alexander, though twice a day in his presence”—καὶ τοὺς μηνυτὰς
τοῦ ἔργου παρελθόντας ἐξελέγξαι Φιλώταν τε καὶ τοὺς ἀμφ᾽ αὐτὸν
<span class="gesperrt">ἄλλοις τε ἐλέγχοις οὐκ ἀφανέσι, καὶ μάλιστα
δὴ</span> ὅτι αὐτὸς Φιλώτας πεπύσθαι μὲν—συνέφη, etc. What these
other <i>indicia</i> were, we are not told; but we may see how slender
was their value, when we learn that the non-revelation admitted by
Philotas was stronger than any of them. The non-revelation, when we
recollect that Nikomachus was the <i>only</i> informant (Arrian loosely
talks of μηνυτὰς, as if there were more), proves absolutely nothing
as to the complicity of Philotas, though it may prove something as
to his indiscretion. Even on this minor charge, Curtius puts into
his mouth a very sufficient exculpation. But if Alexander had taken
a different view, and dismissed or even confined him for it, there
would have been little room for remark.</p>

<p>The point upon which Arrian is at variance with Curtius, is, that
he states “Philotas with the rest to have been shot to death by the
Macedonians”—thus, seemingly contradicting, at least by implication,
the fact of his having been tortured. Now Plutarch, Diodorus, and
Justin, all concur with Curtius in affirming that he was tortured.
On such a matter, I prefer their united authority to that of Ptolemy
and Aristobulus. These two last-mentioned authors were probably quite
content to believe in the complicity of Philotas upon the authority
of Alexander himself; without troubling themselves to criticise the
proofs. They tell us that Alexander vehemently denounced (κατηγορῆσαι
ἰσχυρῶς) Philotas before the assembled soldiers. After this, any
mere shadow or pretence of proof would be sufficient. Moreover,
let us recollect that Ptolemy obtained his promotion, to be one of
the confidential <i>body guards</i> (σωματοφύλακες), out of this very
conspiracy, real or fictitious; he was promoted to the post of the
condemned Demetrius (Arrian, iii. 27. 11).</p>

<p>How little Ptolemy and Aristobulus cared to do justice to any
one whom Alexander hated, may be seen by what they say afterwards
about the philosopher Kallisthenes. Both of them affirmed that the
pages, condemned for conspiracy against Alexander, deposed against
Kallisthenes as having instigated them to the deed (Arrian, iv.
14, 1). Now we know, from the authority of Alexander himself,
whose letters Plutarch quotes (Alexand. 55), that the pages denied
the privity of any one else—maintaining the project to have been
altogether their own. To their great honor, the pages persisted in
this deposition, even under extreme tortures—though they knew that a
deposition against Kallisthenes was desired from them.</p>

<p>My belief is, that Diodorus, Plutarch, Curtius, and Justin,
are correct in stating that Philotas was tortured. Ptolemy and
Aristobulus have thought themselves warranted in omitting this fact,
which they probably had little satisfaction in reflecting upon. If
Philotas was not tortured, there could have been no evidence at all
against Parmenio—for the only evidence against the latter was the
extorted confession of Philotas.</p>

Alexandria in Arachosia is probably Kandahar. But neither the one
nor the other is mentioned as having been founded by <i>Alexander</i>,
either in Arrian or Curtius, or Diodorus. The name Alexandria does
not prove that they were founded by him; for several of the Diadochi
called their own foundations by his name (Strabo, xiii. p. 593).
Considering how very short a time Alexander spent in these regions,
the wonder is, that he could have found time to establish those
foundations which are expressly ascribed to him by Arrian and his
other historians. The authority of Pliny and Steph. Byzant. is hardly
sufficient to warrant us in ascribing to him more. The exact site of
Alexandria ad Caucasum cannot be determined, for want of sufficient
topographical data. There seems much probability that it was at the
place called Beghram, twenty-five miles north-east of Kabul—in the
way between Kabul on the south side of the Hindoo-Koosh, and Anderhab
on the north side. The prodigious number of coins and relics, Greek
as well as Mohammedan, discovered by Mr. Masson at Beghram, supply
better evidence for identifying the site with that of Alexandria ad
Caucasum, than can be pleaded on behalf of any other locality. See
Masson’s Narrative of Journeys in Afghanistan, etc., vol. iii. ch. 7.
p 148 <i>seqq.</i></p>

<p>In crossing the Hindoo-Koosh from south to north Alexander
probably marched by the pass of Bamian, which seems the only one
among the four passes open to an army in the winter. See Wood’s

<p>But in the geographical details of the country, we are at
fault. We have not sufficient data to identify more than one or
two of the localities mentioned, in the narrative of Alexander’s
proceedings, either by Curtius or Arrian. That Marakanda is the
modern Samarkand—the river Polytimetus, the modern Kohik—and Baktra
or Zariaspa the modern Balkh—appears certain; but the attempts made
by commentators to assign the site of other places are not such as to
carry conviction.</p>

<p>In fact, these countries, at the present moment, are known
only superficially as to their general scenery; for purposes of
measurement and geography, they are almost unknown; as may be seen by
any one who reads the Introduction to Erskine’s translation of the
Memoirs of Sultan Baber.</p>

details are peculiarly authentic, as coming from Ptolemy, the person
chiefly concerned.</p>

<p>Aristobulus agreed in the description of the guise in which
Bessus was exhibited, but stated that he was brought up in this way
by Spitamenes and Dataphernes. Curtius (vii. 24, 36) follows this
version. Diodorus also gives an account very like it, mentioning
nothing about Ptolemy (xvii. 83).</p>

Serâ Numinis Vindictâ, p. 557 B; Strabo xi. p. 518: compare also
xiv. p. 634, and xvii. p. 814. This last-mentioned passage of Strabo
helps us to understand the peculiarly strong pious fervor with which
Alexander regarded the temple and oracle of Branchidæ. At the time
when Alexander went up to the oracle of Ammon in Egypt, for the
purpose of affiliating himself to Zeus Ammon, there came to him
envoys from Miletus, announcing that the oracle at Branchidæ, which
had been silent ever since the time of Xerxes, had just begun to give
prophecy, and had certified the fact that Alexander was the son of
Zeus, besides many other encouraging predictions.</p>

<p>The massacre of the Branchidæ by Alexander was described by
Diodorus, but was contained in that part of the seventeenth book
which is lost; there is a great lacuna in the MSS. after cap. 83. The
fact is distinctly indicated in the table of contents prefixed to
Book xvii.</p>

<p>Arrian makes no mention of these descendants of the Branchidæ in
Sogdiana, nor of the destruction of the town and its inhabitants by
Alexander. Perhaps neither Ptolemy nor Aristobulus, said anything
about it. Their silence is not at all difficult to explain, nor does
it, in my judgment, impeach the credibility of the narrative. They
do not feel under obligation to give publicity to the worst acts of
their hero.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_485"><span class="label"><a

in explaining the subjugation and ruin of Krœsus king of Lydia,
that he had thereby expiated the sin of his ancestor in the fifth
generation before (Herodot. i. 91: compare vi. 86). Immediately
before the breaking out of the Peloponnesian war, the Lacedæmonians
called upon the Athenians to expel the descendants of those who
had taken part in the Kylonian sacrilege, 180 years before; they
addressed this injunction with a view to procure the banishment
of Perikles, yet still τοῖς θεοῖς πρῶτον τιμωροῦντες (Thucyd. i.

Bahtrus, Choaspes, and Araxes flowed from the lofty mountain Parnasus
(Paropamisus?) in Asia; and that the Araxes bifurcated, one branch
forming the Tanais, which fell into the Palus Mæotis. For this
fact he refers to the γῆς περιόδοι current in his time. It seems
plain that by the Araxes Aristotle must mean the Jaxartes. We see,
therefore, that Alexander and his companions, in identifying the
Jaxartes with the Tanais, only followed the geographical descriptions
and ideas current in their time. Humboldt remarks several cases in
which the Greek geographers were fond of supposing bifurcation of
rivers (Asie Centrale, vol. ii. p. 291).</p>

<p>Respecting the same country (Sogdiana and Baktria), Mr.
Erskine observes (Introduction to the Memoirs of Sultan Baber, p.
xliii.):—“The face of the country is extremely broken, and divided
by lofty hills; even the plains are diversified by great varieties
of soil,—some extensive districts along the Kohik river, nearly the
whole of Ferghana (along the Jaxartes), the greater part of Kwarizm
along the branches of the Oxus, with the large portions of Balkh,
Badakshan, Kesh, and Hissar, being of uncommon fertility; while
the greater part of the rest is a barren waste, and in some places
a sandy desert. Indeed the whole country north of the Oxus has a
decided tendency to degenerate into desert, and many of its most
fruitful spaces are nearly surrounded by barren sands; so that the
population of all these districts still, as in the time of Baber,
consists of the fixed inhabitants of the cities and fertile lands,
and of the unsettled and roving wanderers of the desert, who dwell in
tents of felt, and live on the produce of their flocks.”</p>

<p id="Footnote_503"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_503">[503]</a></span> Arrian, iv. 8; Curtius, viii.
1; Plutarch, Alexand. 50, 51; Justin, xii. 6.</p>

<p>The description given by Diodorus was contained in the lost part
of his seventeenth book; the table of contents, prefixed thereunto,
notes the incident briefly.</p>

<p>All the authors describe in the same general way the
commencement, progress, and result, of this impressive scene in the
banqueting hall of Marakanda; but they differ materially in the
details. In giving what seems to me the most probable account, I have
borrowed partly from all, yet following mostly the account given by
Arrian from Ptolemy, himself present. For Arrian’s narrative down to
sect. 14 of c. 8 (before the words Ἀριστόβουλος δὲ) may fairly be
presumed to be derived from Ptolemy.</p>

<p>Both Plutarch and Curtius describe the scene in a manner more
dishonorable to Alexander than Arrian; and at the same time (in my
judgment) less probable. Plutarch says that the brawl took its rise
from a poet named Pierion singing a song which turned into derision
those Macedonians who had been recently defeated in Sogdiana; that
Alexander and those around him greatly applauded this satire; that
Kleitus protested against such an insult to soldiers, who, though
unfortunate, had behaved with unimpeachable bravery; that Alexander
then turned upon Kleitus saying, that he was seeking an excuse for
himself by extenuating cowardice in others; that Kleitus retorted
by reminding him of the preservation of his life at the Granikus.
Alexander is thus made to provoke the quarrel by aspersing the
courage of Kleitus, which I think noway probable; nor would he be
likely to encourage a song of that tenor.</p>

<p>Curtius agrees with Arrian in ascribing the origin of the
mischief to the extravagant boasts of Alexander and his flatterers,
and to their depreciation of Philip. He then tells us that Kleitus,
on hearing their unseemly talk, turned round and whispered to his
neighbor some lines out of the Andromachê of Euripides (which lines
Plutarch also ascribes to him, though at a later moment); that
Alexander, not hearing the words, asked what had been said, but no
one would tell him; at length Kleitus himself repeated the sentiment
in language of his own. This would suit a literary Greek; but an old
Macedonian officer half intoxicated, when animated by a vehement
sentiment, would hardly express it by whispering a Greek poetical
quotation to his neighbor. He would either hold his tongue, or speak
what he felt broadly and directly. Nevertheless Curtius has stated
two points very material to the case, which do not appear in Arrian.
1. It was Alexander himself, not his flatterers, who vilipended
Philip; at least the flatterers only did so after him, and following
his example. The topic would be dangerous for them to originate, and
might easily be carried too far. 2. Among all the topics touched
upon by Kleitus, none was so intolerable as the open expression of
sympathy, friendship, and regret for Parmenio. This stung Alexander
in the sorest point of his conscience; he must have known that there
were many present who sympathized with it; and it was probably the
main cause which worked him up to phrenzy. Moreover we may be pretty
sure that Kleitus, while expatiating upon Philip, would not forget
Philip’s general in chief and his own old friend, Parmenio.</p>

<p>I cannot believe the statement of Aristobulus, that Kleitus was
forced by his friends out of the hall, and afterward returned to it
of his own accord, to defy Alexander once more. It seems plain from
Arrian that Ptolemy said no such thing. The murderous impulse of
Alexander was gratified on the spot, and without delay, as soon as he
got clear from the gentle restraint of his surrounding friends.</p>

<p>In explanation of this monstrous verdict of the soldiers, we
must recollect that the safety of the whole army (now at Samarcand,

as having in his historical work flattered Alexander to excess
(Polybius, xii. 12). Kallisthenes seems to have recognized various
special interpositions of the gods, to aid Alexander’s successes—see
Fragments 25 and 36 of the Fragmenta Callisthenis in the edition of
Didot.</p>

<p>In reading the censure which Arrian passes on the arrogant
pretensions of Kallisthenes, we ought at the same time to read the
pretensions raised by Arrian on his own behalf as an historian (i.
12, 7-9)—καὶ ἐπὶ τῷδε οὐκ ἀπαξιῶ ἐμαυτὸν τῶν πρώτων ἐν τῇ φωνῇ τῇ
Ἑλλάδι, εἴπερ καὶ Ἀλέξανδρος τῶν ἐν τοῖς ὅπλοις, etc. I doubt much
whether Kallisthenes pitched his self-estimation so high. In this
chapter, Arrian recounts, that Alexander envied Achilles for having
been fortunate enough to obtain such a poet as Homer for panegyrist;
and Arrian laments that Alexander had not, as yet, found an historian
equal to his deserts. This, in point of fact, is a reassertion of the
same truth which Kallisthenes stands condemned for asserting—that the
fame even of the greatest warrior depends upon his commemorators. The
boastfulness of a poet is at least pardonable, when he exclaims, like
Theokritus, Idyll. xvi. 73—</p>

deeply rooted in the free Grecian mind, prior to Alexander’s
conquests, than the repugnance to arrogant aspirations on the part of
the fortunate man, swelling himself above the limits of humanity—and
the belief that such aspirations were followed by the Nemesis of
the gods. In the dying speech which Xenophon puts into the mouth of
Cyrus the Great, we find—“Ye gods, I thank you much, that I have been
sensible of your care for me, and that I have never in my successes
raised my thoughts above the measure of man” (Cyropæd. viii. 7, 3).
Among the most striking illustrations of this sentiment is, the story
of Solon and Crœsus (Herodot. i. 32-34).</p>

<p>Kraterus was at this time absent in Sogdiana, engaged in finishing

therefore, Alexander would naturally write.</p>

<p>This statement, from the pen of Alexander himself, distinctly

<p>This is the statement of Ptolemy; who was himself concerned in
the transactions, and was the officer through whom the conspiracy
of the pages had been revealed. His partiality might permit him to
omit or soften what was discreditable to Alexander, but he may be
fully trusted when he records an act of cruelty. Aristobulus and
others affirmed that Kallisthenes was put in chains and carried
about in this condition for some time; after which he died of
disease and a wretched state of body. But the witnesses here are
persons whose means of information we do not know to be so good as

<p id="Footnote_535"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_535">[535]</a></span> Respecting the rock called
Aornos, a valuable and elaborate article, entitled “Gradus ad Aornon”
has been published by Major Abbott in the Journal of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal, No. iv. 1854. This article gives much information,
collected mainly by inquiries on the spot, and accompanied by a map,
about the very little known country west of the Indus, between the
Kabool river on the south, and the Hindoo-Koosh on the north.</p>

<p>Major Abbott attempts to follow the march and operations of
Alexander, from Alexandria ad Caucasum to the rock of Aornos (p.
311 <i>seq.</i>). He shows highly probable reason for believing that
the Aornos described by Arrian is the Mount Mahabunn, near the
right bank of the Indus (lat. 34° 20´), about sixty miles above its
confluence with the Kabool river. “The whole account of Arrian of
the rock Aornos is a faithful picture of the Mahabunn. It was the
most remarkable feature of the country. It was the refuge of all
the neighboring tribes. It was covered with forest. It had good
soil sufficient for a thousand ploughs, and pure springs of water
everywhere abounded. It was 4125 feet above the plain, and fourteen
miles in circuit. The summit was a plain where cavalry could act.
It would be difficult to offer a more faithful description of the
Mahabunn. The side on which Alexander scaled the main summit had
certainly the character of a rock. But the whole description of
Arrian indicates a table mountain” (p. 341). The Mahabunn “is a
mountain table, scarped on the east by tremendous precipices, from
which descends one large spur down upon the Indus between Sitana and
Umb” (p. 340).</p>

<p>To this similarity in so many local features, is to be added the
remarkable coincidence of name, between the town Embolima, where
Arrian states that Alexander established his camp for the purpose of
attacking Aornos—and the modern names Umb and Balimah (between the
Mahabunn and the Indus)—“the one in the river valley, the other on
the mountain immediately above it” (p. 344). Mount Mahabunn is the
natural refuge for the people of the neighborhood from a conqueror,
and was among the places taken by Nadir Shah (p. 338).</p>

<p>A strong case of identity is thus made out between this mountain
and the Aornos <i>described by Arrian</i>. But undoubtedly it does not
coincide with the Aornos <i>described by Curtius</i>, who compares Aornos
to a Meta (the conical goal of the stadium), and says that the
Indus washed its base,—that at the first assault several Macedonian
soldiers were hurled down into the river. This close juxtaposition of
the Indus has been the principal feature looked for by travellers who
have sought for Aornos; but no place has yet been found answering the
conditions required. We have here to make our election between Arrian
and Curtius. Now there is a general presumption in Arrian’s favor,
in the description of military operations, where he makes a positive
statement; but in this case, the presumption is peculiarly strong,
because Ptolemy was in the most conspicuous and difficult command for
the capture of Aornos, and was therefore likely to be particular in
the description of a scene where he had reaped much glory.</p>

<p>The countries here traversed by Alexander include parts of
Kafiristan, Swart, Bajore, Chitral, the neighborhood of the Kameh
and other affluents of the river Kabul before it falls into the
Indus near Attock. Most of this is Terra Incognita even at present;
especially Kafiristan, a territory inhabited by a population said
to be rude and barbarous, but which has never been conquered—nor
indeed ever visited by strangers. It is remarkable, that among the
inhabitants of Kafiristan,—as well as among those of Badakshan, on
the other or northern side of the Hindoo-Koosh—there exist traditions
respecting Alexander, together with a sort of belief that they
themselves are descended from his soldiers. See Ritter’s Erdkunde,

though both present, differed on many points, v. 14); Curtius, viii.
13, 14; Diodor. xvii. 87, 88. According to Plutarch (Alex. 60),
Alexander dwelt much upon the battle in his own letters.</p>

<p>There are two principal points—Jelum and Julalpoor—where high
roads from the Indus now cross the Hydaspes. Each of these points
have been assigned by different writers, as the probable scene of the
crossing of the river by Alexander. Of the two Jelum (rather higher
up the river than Julalpoor) seems the more probable. Burnes points
out that near Jelum the river is divided into five or six channels
with islands (Travels, vol. ii. ch. 2. p. 50, 2nd ed.). Captain
Abbott (in the Journal of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, Dec. 1848)
has given an interesting memoir on the features and course of the
Hydaspes a little above Jelum, comparing them with the particulars
stated by Arrian, and showing highly plausible reasons in support of
this hypothesis—that the crossing took place near Jelum.</p>

<p>Diodorus mentions a halt of thirty days, after the victory (xvii.
89), which seems not probable. Both he and Curtius allude to numerous
serpents, by which the army was annoyed between the Akesines and the
Hydraotes (Curtius, ix. 1, 11).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_541"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_541">[541]</a></span> Arrian states (v. 19, 5)
that the victory over Porus was gained in the month Munychion of
the archon Hegemon at Athens—that is, about the end of April, 326
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> This date is not to be reconciled with
another passage, v. 9, 6—where he says that the summer solstice had
already passed, and that all the rivers of the Punjab were full of
water, turbid and violent.</p>

<p>This swelling of the rivers begins about June; they do not attain
their full height until August. Moreover, the description of the
battle, as given both by Arrian and by Curtius, implies that it took
place after the rainy season had begun (Arrian, v. 9, 7; v. 12, 5.
Curtius, viii. 14, 4).</p>

<p>Some critics have proposed to read <i>Metageitnion</i> (July-August)
as the month, instead of <i>Munychion</i>; an alteration approved by
Mr. Clinton and received into the text by Schmieder. But if this
alteration be admitted, the name of the Athenian archon must be
altered also; for Metageitnion of the archon Hegemon would be eight
months earlier (July-August, 327 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); and at
this date Alexander had not as yet crossed the Indus, as the passage
of Aristobulus (ap. Strabo. xv. p. 691) plainly shows—and as Droysen
and Mützel remark. Alexander did not cross the Indus before the
spring of 326 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> If, in place of the archon
Hegemon, we substitute the next following archon Chremês (and it is
remarkable that Diodorus assigns the battle to this later archonship,
xvii. 87), this would be July-August 326 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>;
which would be a more admissible date for the battle than the
preceding month of Munychion. At the same time, the substitution of
Metageitnion <i>is</i> mere conjecture; and seems to leave hardly time
enough for the subsequent events. As far as an opinion can be formed,
it would seem that the battle was fought about the end of June or
beginning of July 326 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> after the rainy
season had commenced; towards the close of the archonship of Hegemon,
and the beginning of that of Chremes.</p>

<p id="Footnote_548"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_548">[548]</a></span> In the speech which Arrian
(v. 25, 26) puts into the mouth of Alexander, the most curious
point is, the geographical views which he promulgates. “We have not
much farther now to march (he was standing on the western bank of
the Sutledge) to the river Ganges, and the great Eastern Sea which
surrounds the whole earth. The Hyrkanian (Caspian) Sea joins on to
this great sea on one side, the Persian Gulf on the other; after we
have subdued all those nations which lie before us eastward towards
the Great Sea, and northward towards the Hyrkanian Sea, we shall
then sail by water first to the Persian Gulf, next round Libya to
the pillars of Herakles; from thence we shall march back all through
Libya, and add it to all Asia as parts of our empire.” (I here
abridge rather than translate).</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that while Alexander made so prodigious
an error in narrowing the eastern limits of Asia, the Ptolemaic
geography, recognized in the time of Columbus, made an error not
less in the opposite direction, stretching it too far to the East.
It was upon the faith of this last mistake, that Columbus projected
his voyage of circumnavigation from Western Europe, expecting to come
to the eastern coast of Asia from the West, after no great length of
voyage.</p>

<p>The site of Pattala has been usually looked for near the modern
Tatta. But Dr. Kennedy, in his recent ‘Narrative of the Campaign of
the Army of the Indus in Scinde and Kabool’ (ch. v. p. 104), shows
some reasons for thinking that it must have been considerably higher
up the river than Tatta; somewhere near Sehwan. “The delta commencing
about 130 miles above the sea, its northern apex would be somewhere
midway between Hyderabad and Sehwan; where local traditions still
speak of ancient cities destroyed, and of greater changes having
occurred than in any other part of the course of the Indus.”</p>

<p>The constant changes in the course of the Indus, however (compare
p. 73 of his work), noticed by all observers, render every attempt at
such identification conjectural—see Wood’s Journey to the Oxus, p.
12.</p>

it. There may have been exaggerations or falsities as to the details
of the march; but as a general fact, I see no sufficient ground for
disbelieving it. A season of excessive license to the soldiers, after
their extreme suffering in Gedrosia, was by no means unnatural to
grant. Moreover, it corresponds to the general conception of the
returning march of Dionysus in antiquity, while the imitation of that
god was quite in conformity with Alexander’s turn of sentiment.</p>

<p>I have already remarked, that the silence of Ptolemy and
Aristobulus is too strongly insisted on, both by Arrian and by
others, as a reason for disbelieving affirmations respecting
Alexander.</p>

<p>Arrian and Curtius (x. 1) differ in their statements about the

Hellen. <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 325, also Append. p. 232) places
the arrival of Alexander in Susiana, on his return march, in the
month of February <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 325; a year too early,
in my opinion. I have before remarked on the views of Mr. Clinton
respecting the date of Alexander’s victory over Porus on the
Hydaspes, where he alters the name of the month as it stands in the
text of Arrian (following Schmieder’s conjecture), and supposes
that battle to have occurred in August <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
327 instead of April <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 326. Mr. Clinton
antedates by one year all the proceedings of Alexander subsequent
to his quitting Baktria for the last time in the summer of
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 327. Dr. Vincent’s remark—“that the
supposition of <i>two winters</i> occurring after Alexander’s return to
Susa is not borne out by the historians” (see Clinton. p. 232),
is a perfectly just one; and Mitford has not replied to it in a
satisfactory manner. In my judgment, there was only an interval
of sixteen months (not an interval of twenty-eight months, as Mr.
Clinton supposes) between the return of Alexander to Susa and his
death at Babylon (Feb. 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> to June 323

<p id="Footnote_578"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_578">[578]</a></span> Among the accusations which
reached Alexander against this satrap, we are surprised to find a
letter addressed to him (ἐν τῇ πρὸς Ἀλέξανδρον ἐπιστολῇ) by the Greek
historian Theopompus; who set forth with indignation the extravagant
gifts and honors heaped by Harpalus upon his two successive
mistresses—Pythionikê and Glykera; celebrated Hetæræ from Athens.
These proceedings Theopompus describes as insults to Alexander
(Theopompus ap. Athenæ. xiii. p. 586-595; Fragment. 277, 278 ed.
Didot).</p>

<p>The satyric drama called Ἀγὴν, represented before Alexander at
a period subsequent to the flight of Harpalus, cannot have been
represented (as Athenæus states it to have been) on the banks of
<i>the Hydaspes</i>, because Harpalus did not make his escape until he
was frightened by the approach of Alexander <i>returning</i> from India.
At the Hydaspes, Alexander was still on his outward progress; very
far off, and without any idea of returning. It appears to me that
the words of Athenæus respecting this drama—ἐδίδαξε Διονυσίων ὄντων
ἐπὶ τοῦ <span class="gesperrt">Ὑδάσπου</span> τοῦ ποταμοῦ (xiii, p.
595)—involve a mistake or misreading; and that it ought to stand ἐπὶ
τοῦ <span class="gesperrt">Χοάσπου</span> τοῦ ποταμοῦ. I may remark
that the words <i>Medus Hydaspes</i> in Virgil, Georg. iv. 211, probably
involve the same confusion. The Choaspes was the river, near Susa;
and this drama was performed before Alexander at Susa during the
Dionysia of the year 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, after Harpalus
had fled. The Dionysia were in the month Elaphebolion; now Alexander
did not fight Porus on the Hydaspes until the succeeding month
Munychion at the earliest—and probably later. And even if we suppose
(which is not probable) that he reached the Hydaspes in Elaphebolion,
he would have no leisure to celebrate dramas and a Dionysiac
festival, while the army of Porus was waiting for him on the opposite
bank. Moreover it is no way probable that, on the remote Hydaspes, he
had any actors or chorus, or means of celebrating dramas at all.</p>

royal road (xix. 19), is traced by Ritter, deriving his information
chiefly from the recent researches of Major Rawlinson. The larger
portion of the way lay along the western side of the chain of Mount
Zagros, and on the right bank of the river Kerkha (Ritter, Erdkunde,
part ix. b. 3. p. 329, West Asia).</p>

<p>On the whole, though the point is doubtful, I incline to believe
the assertion of a Roman embassy to Alexander. Nevertheless, there
were various false statements which afterwards became current about
it—one of which may be seen in Memnon’s history of the Pontic
Herakleia ap. Photium, Cod. 224; Orelli Fragment. Memnon, p. 36.
Kleitarchus (contemporary of Alexander), whom Pliny quotes, can have

to Alexander; really as an emissary to acquaint himself with the
king’s real designs, which occasioned to the Carthaginians serious
alarm—but under color of being an exile tendering his services.
Justin says that Parmenio introduced Hamilkar—which must, I think, be
an error.</p>

decease) of prospective schemes. But the funeral pile had already
been erected at Babylon, as Diodorus himself had informed us.</p>

<p>What Alexander left unexecuted at his decease, but intended to
execute if he had lived, was the splendid edifices and chapels in
Hephæstion’s honor—as we see by Arrian, vii. 23, 10. And Diodorus
must be supposed to allude to these intended sacred buildings, though
he has inadvertently spoken of the funeral pile. Kraterus, who was
under orders to return to Macedonia, was to have built one at Pella.

<p>The uneasiness here caused by these prophecies and omens, in
the mind of the most fearless man of his age, is worthy of notice
as a psychological fact, and is perfectly attested by the authority
of Aristobulus and Nearchus. It appears that Anaxarchus and other
Grecian philosophers encouraged him by their reasonings to despise
all prophecy, but especially that of the Chaldæan priests; who (they
alleged) wished to keep Alexander out of Babylon in order that they
might continue to possess the large revenues of the temple of Belus,
which they had wrongfully appropriated; Alexander being disposed
to rebuild that ruined temple, and to re-establish the suspended
sacrifices to which its revenues had been originally devoted (Arrian,
vii. 17; Diodor. xvii. 112). Not many days afterwards, Alexander
greatly repented of having given way to these dangerous reasoners,
who by their sophistical cavils set aside the power and the warnings
of destiny (Diodor. xvii. 116).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_615"><span class="label"><a

states (xvii. 117) that Alexander, on this convivial night, swallowed
the contents of a large goblet called the cup of Herakles, and felt
very ill after it; a statement repeated by various other writers of
antiquity, and which I see no reason for discrediting, though some
modern critics treat it with contempt. The royal Ephemerides, or
Court Journal, attested only the general fact of his long potations
and the long sleep which followed them: see Athenæus, x. p. 434.</p>

<p>To drink to intoxication at a funeral, was required as a token
of respectful sympathy towards the deceased—see the last words of
the Indian Kalanus before he ascended the funeral pile—Plutarch,
Alexander, 69.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_616"><span class="label"><a

mentioned by Arrian (vii. 26, 5) and Diodorus (xvii. 117), and Justin
(xii. 15): but they found no place in the Court Journal. Curtius (x.
v. 4) gives them with some enlargement.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_617"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_617">[617]</a></span> The details, respecting the
last illness of Alexander, are peculiarly authentic, being extracted
both by Arrian and by Plutarch, from the Ephemerides Regiæ, or short
Court Journal; which was habitually kept by his secretary Eumenes,
and another Greek named Diodotus (Athenæ. x. p. 434): see Arrian,
vii. 25, 26; Plutarch, Alex. 76.</p>

<p>It is surprising that throughout all the course of this malady
no mention is made of any physician as having been consulted. No
advice was asked; if we except the application to the temple of
Serapis, during the last day of Alexander’s life. A few months
before, Alexander had hanged or crucified the physician who attended
Hephæstion in his last illness. Hence it seems probable that he
either despised or mistrusted medical advice, and would not permit
any to be invoked. His views must have been much altered since his
dangerous fever at Tarsus, and the successful treatment of it by the
Akarnanian physician Philippus.</p>

<p>Though the fever (see some remarks from Littré attached to
Didot’s Fragm. Script. Alex. Magn. p. 124) which caused Alexander’s
death is here a plain fact satisfactorily made out, yet a different
story was circulated some time afterwards, and gained partial
credit (Plutarch De Invidiâ, p. 538), that he had been poisoned.
The poison was said to have been provided by Aristotle,—sent over
to Asia by Antipater through his son Kassander,—and administered by
Iollas (another son of Antipater), Alexander’s cupbearer (Arrian,
vii. 27, 2; Curtius, x. 10, 17; Diodor. xvii. 118; Justin, xii.
13). It is quite natural that fever and intemperance (which latter
moreover was frequent with Alexander) should not be regarded as
causes sufficiently marked and impressive to explain a decease
at once so unexpected and so momentous. There seems ground for
supposing, however, that the report was intentionally fomented,
if not originally broached, by the party-enemies of Antipater and
Kassander—especially by the rancorous Olympias. The violent enmity
afterwards displayed by Kassander against Olympias, and all the
family of Alexander helped to encourage the report. In the life of
Hyperides in Plutarch, (Vit. X. Oratt. p. 849) it is stated, that
he proposed at Athens public honors to Iollas for having given the
poison to Alexander. If there is any truth in this, it might be a
stratagem for casting discredit on Antipater (father of Iollas),
against whom the Athenians entered into the Lamian war, immediately
after the death of Alexander.</p>

<p>Strabo (or Eratosthenes, see Strabo, i. p. 66) and Plutarch
understand the expression of Aristotle erroneously—as if that
philosopher had meant to recommend harsh and cruel treatment of the
non-Hellenes, and kind treatment only towards Greeks. That Aristotle
could have meant no such thing, is evident from the whole tenor of
his treatise on Politics. The distinction really intended is between
a greater and a less measure of extra-popular authority—not between
kind and unkind purposes in the exercise of authority. Compare
Tacitus, Annal. xii. 11—the advice of the Emperor Claudius to the
Parthian prince Meherdates.</p>

former to be courageous and energetic, but wanting in intelligence
or powers of political combination; the latter to be intelligent and
clever in contrivance, but destitute of courage. Neither of them have
more than a “one-legged aptitude” (φύσιν μονόκωλον); the Greek alone
possesses both the courage and intelligence united. The Asiatics are
condemned to perpetual subjection; the Greeks might govern the world
could they but combine in one political society.</p>

<p id="Footnote_645"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_645">[645]</a></span> Plutarch, Fortun. Al. M.
p. 328. Plutarch mentions, a few lines afterwards, Seleukeia
in Mesopotamia, as if he thought that it was among the cities
established by Alexander himself. This shows that he has not been
exact in distinguishing foundations made by Alexander, from those
originated by Seleukus and the other Diadochi.</p>

<p>The elaborate article of Droysen (in the Appendix to his
Geschichte des Hellenismus, p. 588-651), ascribes to Alexander the
largest plans of colonization in Asia, and enumerates a great number
of cities alleged to have been founded by him. But in regard to
the majority of these foundations, the evidence upon which Droysen
grounds his belief that Alexander was the founder, appears to me
altogether slender and unsatisfactory. If Alexander founded so many
cities as Droysen imagines, how does it happen that Arrian mentions
only so comparatively small a number? The argument derived from
Arrian’s silence, for rejecting what is affirmed by other ancients
respecting Alexander, is indeed employed by modern authors (and by
Droysen himself among them), far oftener than I think warrantable.
But if there be any one proceeding of Alexander more than another, in
respect of which the silence of Arrian ought to make us suspicious—it
is the foundation of a new colony; a solemn act, requiring delay and
multiplied regulations, intended for perpetuity, and redounding to
the honor of the founder. I do not believe in any colonies founded
by Alexander, beyond those comparatively few which Arrian mentions,
except such as rest upon some other express and good testimony.
Whoever will read through Droysen’s list, will see that most of the
names in it will not stand this test. The short life, and rapid
movements, of Alexander, are of themselves the strongest presumption
against his having founded so large a number of colonies.</p>

have always used the word Hellenism, throughout the present Work.</p>

<p>With Droysen, the word <i>Hellenismus</i>—<i>Das Hellenistische
Staatensystem</i>—is applied to the state of things which followed
upon Alexander’s death; to the aggregate of kingdoms into which
Alexander’s conquests become distributed, having for their point of
similarity the common use of Greek speech, a certain proportion of
Greeks both as inhabitants and as officers, and a partial streak of
Hellenic culture.</p>

<p>I cannot but think that such an employment of the word is
misleading. At any rate, its sense must be constantly kept in mind,
in order that it may not be confounded with <i>hellenism</i> in the
stricter meaning.</p>

<p>The Museum of Alexandria (with its library) must be carefully
distinguished from the city and the people. It was an artificial
institution, which took its rise altogether from the personal taste
and munificence of the earlier Ptolemies, especially the second.
It was one of the noblest and most useful institutions recorded in
history, and forms the most honorable monument of what Droysen calls
the <i>hellenistic</i> period, between the death of Alexander and the
extension of the Roman empire into Asia. But this Museum, though
situated at Alexandria, had no peculiar connection with the city
or its population; it was a College of literary Fellows (if we may
employ a modern word) congregated out of various Grecian towns.
Eratosthenes, Kallimuchus, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, were not
natives of Alexandria.</p>

to put force upon the divine arrangements”, τὰ θεῖα βιάσασθαι. He
wished to cut through the isthmus between Teos and Klazomenæ, so as
to avoid the navigation round the cliffs of Mimas (σκόπελον νιφόεντα
Μίμαντος—Aristophan. Nub. 274) between Chios and Erythræ. Probably
this was among the projects suggested to Alexander, in the last year
of his life. We have no other information about it.</p>

authors have concluded from Arrian’s silence that he disbelieved the
fact: if he had disbelieved it, I think that he would have mentioned
the statement of Herodotus nevertheless, with an intimation that he

in honor of Lykurgus, passed by the Athenian people seventeen or
eighteen years after his death, in the archonship of Anaxikrates,
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 307 (Plutarch, Vit. X. Oratt. p. 852).
The reciting portion of this decree, constituting four-fifths of
the whole, goes over the public conduct of Lykurgus, and is very
valuable.</p>

<p>It seems that the twelve years of financial administration
exercised by Lykurgus, are to be taken probably, either from
342-330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—or four years later, from 338-326
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Boeckh leaves the point undetermined
between the two. Droysen and Meier prefer the earlier period—O.
Müller the later. (Boeckh, Urkunden über das Attische Seewesen, also
the second edition of his Staatshaushaltung der Athener, vol. ii. p.
114-118).</p>

<p>The total of public money, recorded by the Inscription as
having passed through the hands of Lykurgus in the twelve years,
was 18,900 talents = £4,340,000, or thereabouts. He is said to
have held, besides, in deposit, a great deal of money entrusted to
him by private individuals. His official duties as treasurer were
discharged, for the first four years, in his own name: during the
last eight years, in the names of two different friends.</p>

mentions this mission of Ktesiphon to Kleopatra. He also (in the same
oration, p. 550) charges Demosthenes with having sent letters to
Alexander, soliciting pardon and favor. He states that a young man
named Aristion, a friend of Demosthenes, was much about the person
of Alexander, and that through him the letters were sent. He cites
as his authority the seamen of the public Athenian vessel called
<i>Paralus</i>, and the Athenian envoys who went to Alexander in Phenicia
in the spring or summer of 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (compare
Arrian, iii. 6, 3). Hyperides also seems to have advanced the like
allegation against Demosthenes—see Harpokration, v. Ἀριστίων.</p>

<p>The fragments of the oration of Hyperides in defence of
Euxenippus (recently published by Mr. Churchill Babington), delivered
at some period during the reign of Alexander, give general evidence
of the wide-spread feeling of jealous aversion to the existing
Macedonian ascendancy. Euxenippus had been accused of devotion to
Macedonia; Hyperides strenuously denies it, saying that Euxenippus
had never been in Macedonia, nor ever conversed with any Macedonian
who came to Athens. Even boys at school (says Hyperides) know the
names of the corrupt orators, or servile flatterers, who serve
Macedonia—Euxenippus is not among them (p 11, 12).</p>

got possession of the Persian treasures at Susa (about December
331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), sent a large remittance of 3000
talents to Antipater, as means for carrying on the war against the
Lacedæmonians (Arrian, iii. 16. 17). The manifestations of Agis in
Peloponnesus had begun in the spring of 331 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
(Arrian, iii. 6, 4); but his aggressive movements in Peloponnesus
did not assume formidable proportions until the spring of 330
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> At the date of the speech of Æschines
against Ktesiphon (August 330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the
decisive battle by which Antipater crushed the forces of Agis had
only recently occurred; for the Lacedæmonian prisoners were only
<i>about to be sent</i> to Alexander to learn their fate (Æsch. adv. Kt.
p. 524). Curtius (vii. 1, 21) is certainly mistaken in saying that
the contest was terminated before the battle of Arbela. Moreover,
there were Lacedæmonian envoys, present with Darius until a few days
before his death (July 330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), who afterwards
fell into the hands of Alexander (Arrian iii. 24, 7); these men
could hardly have known of the prostration of their country at home.
I suppose the victory of Antipater to have taken place about June
330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—and the Peloponnesian armament of
Agis to have been got together about three months before (March 330
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>).</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton (Fast. H. App. c. 4. p. 234) discusses the chronology
of this event, but in a manner which I cannot think satisfactory. He
seems inclined to put it some months earlier. I see no necessity for
construing the dictum ascribed to Alexander (Plutarch, Agesilaus, 15)
as proving close coincidence of time between the battle of Arbela and
the final defeat of Agis.</p>

there appears one (p. 266) purporting to be the very decree moved
by Ktesiphon; and another (p. 243) purporting to be the accusation
preferred by Æschines. I have already stated that I agree with
Droysen in mistrusting all the documents annexed to this oration; all
of them bear the name of wrong archons, most of them names of unknown
archons; some of them do not fit the place in which they appear. See
my preceding Vol. XI. Ch. lxxxix. p. 424; Ch. xc. p. 456-486.</p>

<p>We know from the statement of Æschines himself that the motion
of Ktesiphon was made after the appointment of Demosthenes to be one
of the inspectors of the fortifications of the city; and that this
appointment took place in the last month of the archon Chærondas
(June 337 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—see Æschines adv. Ktesiph. p.
421-426). We also know that the accusation of Æschines against
Ktesiphon was preferred before the assassination of Philip, which
took place in August 336 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (Æschin. ib. p.
612, 613). It thus appears that the motion of Ktesiphon (with the
probouleuma which followed upon it) must have occurred some time
during the autumn or winter of 337-336 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—that
the accusation of Æschines must have been handed in shortly after
it—and that this accusation cannot have been handed in at the date
borne by the pseudo-document, p. 243—the month Elaphebolion of the
archon Chærondas, which would be anterior to the appointment of
Demosthenes. Moreover, whoever compares the so-called motion of
Ktesiphon, as it stands inserted Demosth. De Coronâ, p. 266, with the
words in which Æschines himself (Adv. Ktesiph. p. 631. ὅθεν τὴν ἀρχὴν

that motion, will see that it cannot be genuine.</p>

Babington from a recently discovered Egyptian papyrus (Cambridge,
1850). From Fragm. 14 (p. 38 of Mr. Babington’s edition) we may
see that the promises mentioned in the text were actually held
out by Harpalus—indeed we might almost have presumed it without
positive evidence. Hyperides addresses Demosthenes—ταύτας ὑπ...ις
τῷ ψηφίσματι, συλλαβὼν τὸν Ἅρπαλον· καὶ τοὺς μὲν ἄλλους ἅπαντας

<p>From the language thus used by Hyperides in his accusation, we
are made to perceive what prospects he (and of course Harpalus, upon
whose authority he must have spoken) had held out to the people when
the case was first under discussion.</p>

<p>The fragment here cited is complete as to the main sense, not
requiring very great help from conjecture. In some of the other
fragments, the conjectural restorations of Mr. Babington, though
highly probable and judicious, form too large a proportion of the
whole to admit of our citing them with confidence as testimony.</p>

<p>Deinarchus, in his loose rhetoric, tries to put the case as if
Demosthenes had proposed to recognize the sentence of the Areopagus
as final and peremptory, and stood therefore condemned upon the
authority invoked by himself. But this is refuted sufficiently by the
mere fact that the trial was instituted afterwards; besides that, it

<p>In the second and third Epistles ascribed to Demosthenes (p.

condemned by the Dykastery, because his trial had come on first—that
Aristogeiton and all the others tried were acquitted, though the
charge against all was the same, and the evidence against all was
the same also—viz. nothing more than the simple report of the
Areopagus. As I agree with those who hold these epistles to be
probably spurious, I cannot believe, on such authority alone, that
all the other persons tried were acquitted—a fact highly improbable

<p id="Footnote_722"><span class="label"><a

Photium (Cod. 265), the service alleged to have been rendered by him
to Harpalus, and for which he was charged with having received 1000
Darics, is put as I have stated it in the text—Demosthenes first
spoke publicly against receiving Harpalus, but presently Δαρεικοὺς
χιλίους (<span class="gesperrt">ὥς φασι</span>) λαβὼν πρὸς τοὺς ὑπὲρ
αὐτοῦ λέγοντας μετετάξατο (then follow the particular acts whereby
this alleged change of sentiment was manifested, which particular
acts are described as follows)—καὶ βουλομένων τῶν Ἀθηναίων Ἀντιπάτρῳ
προδοῦναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἀντεῖπεν, τά τε Ἁρπάλεια χρήματα εἰς ἀκρόπολιν
ἔγραψεν ἀποθέσθαι, μηδὲ τῷ δήμῳ τὸν ἀριθμὸν αὐτῶν ἀποσημηνάμενος.</p>

<p>That Demosthenes should first oppose the reception of
Harpalus—and then afterwards oppose the surrender of Harpalus
to Antipater’s requisition—is here represented as a change of
politics requiring the hypothesis of a bribe to explain it. But it
is in reality no change at all. The two proceedings are perfectly
consistent with each other, and both of them defensible.</p>

</p>

<p>In p. 26 of the same Fragments, we find Hyperides reproaching
Demosthenes for not having kept effective custody over the person
of Harpalus; for not having proposed any decree providing a special
custody; for not having made known beforehand, or prosecuted
afterwards, the negligence of the ordinary jailers. This is to
make Demosthenes responsible for the performance of <i>all</i> the
administrative duties of the city; for the good conduct of the
treasurers and the jailers.</p>

<p>We must recollect that Hyperides had been the loudest advocate
of Harpalus, and had done all he could to induce the Athenians to
adopt the cause of that exile against Alexander. One of the charges
(already cited from his speech) against Demosthenes, is, that
Demosthenes prevented this from being accomplished. Yet here is
another charge from the same speaker, to the effect that Demosthenes
did not keep Harpalus under effective custody for the sword of the
Macedonian executioner!</p>

<p>The line of accusation taken by Hyperides is full of shameful
inconsistencies.</p>

<p id="Footnote_724"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_724">[724]</a></span> In the Life of Demosthenes
(Plutarch, Vit. X Oratt. p. 846), the charge of corruption against
him is made to rest chiefly on the fact, that he did not make this
communication to the people—καὶ διὰ τοῦτο μήτε τὸν ἀριθμὸν τῶν
ἀνακομισθέντων μεμηνυκὼς μήτε τῶν φυλασσόντων ἀμελείαν, etc. The
biography apud Photium seems to state it as if Demosthenes did not
communicate the amount, <i>at the time</i> when he proposed the decree of
sequestration. This last statement we are enabled to contradict, from
the testimony of Hyperides.</p>

seized one of the slaves of Harpalus, learnt from him the names of
those Athenians whom his master had corrupted; and that Demosthenes
was <i>not</i> among them. As far as this statement goes, it serves to
exculpate Demosthenes. Yet I cannot assign so much importance to
it as Bishop Thirlwall seems to do. His narrative of the Harpalian
transactions is able and discriminating (Hist. vol. vii. ch. 56. p.

xviii. 21. Pausanias (i. 25, 5; viii. 52, 2) affirms that Leosthenes
brought over 50,000 of these mercenaries from Asia into Peloponnesus,
during the lifetime of Alexander, and against Alexander’s will.
The number here given seems incredible; but it is probable enough
that he induced some to come across.—Justin (xiii. 5) mentions that
armed resistance was prepared by the Athenians and Ætolians against
Alexander himself during the latter months of his life, in reference
to the mandate enjoining recall of the exiles. He seems to overstate
the magnitude of their doings, before the death of Alexander.</p>

states that the Athenians sent the Harpalian treasures to the aid of
Leosthenes. He seems to fancy that Harpalus had brought to Athens
all the 5000 talents which he had carried away from Asia; but it
is certain, that no more than 700 or 720 talents were declared by
Harpalus in the Athenian assembly—and of these only half were really
forthcoming. Moreover, Diodorus is not consistent with himself, when
he says afterwards (xviii. 19) that Thimbron, who killed Harpalus in
Krete, got possession of the Harpalian treasures and mercenaries, and
carried them over to Kyrênê in Africa.</p>

general of eighty years old, kept them back, by calling out the
citizens of sixty years old and upwards for service, and offering
to march himself at their head (Plutarch, Reip. Ger. Præcept. p.

<p>Cornelius Nepos, Eumenes, 6. “Ad hunc (Eumenem) Olympias,
quum literas et nuntios misisset in Asiam, consultum, utrum
repetitum Macedoniam veniret (nam tum in Epiro habitabat) et eas
res occuparet—huic ille primum suasit ne se moveret, et expectaret

raperetur in Macedoniam, omnium injuriarum oblivisceretur, et in
neminem acerbiore uteretur imperio. Horum illa nihil fecit. Nam et

Justin, xiv. 6; Diodor. xix. 11.</p>

<p>The details respecting Eumenes may be considered probably as
depending on unusually good authority. His friend Hieronymus of
Kardia had written a copious history of his own time; which, though
now lost, was accessible both to Diodorus and Plutarch. Hieronymus
was serving with Eumenes, and was taken prisoner along with him by
Antigonus; who spared him and treated him well, while Eumenes was put
to death (Diodor. xix. 44). Plutarch had also read letters of Eumenes
(Plut. Eum. 11).</p>

tradition and capture of Eumenes. On this point Diodorus is more
brief; but he recounts at much length the preceding military
operations between Eumenes and Antigonus (xix. 17, 32, 44).</p>

<p>The original source of these particulars must probably be, the
history of Hieronymus of Kardia, himself present, and copied, more or
less accurately, by others.</p>

The opinion of Plutarch, however, that Polysperchon intended
this measure as a mere trick to ruin Phokion, is only correct so
far—that Polysperchon wished to put down the Antipatrian oligarchies
everywhere, and that Phokion was the leading person of that oligarchy
at Athens.</p>

combining Plutarch with Diodorus. Plutarch takes no notice of the
negotiation opened by Phokion with Alexander, and the understanding
established between them; which is stated in the clearest manner by
Diodorus, and appears to me a material circumstance. On the other
hand, Plutarch mentions (though Diodorus does not) that Alexander
was anxious to seize Athens itself, and was very near succeeding.
Plutarch seems to conceive that it was the exiles who were disposed
to let him in; but if that had been the case, he probably would have
been let in when the exiles became preponderant. It was Phokion, I
conceive, who was desirous, for his own personal safety, of admitting
the foreign troops.</p>

<p>Plutarch says that Polysperchon, before he gave this hearing to

to be put to death. Now the person so named cannot be Deinarchus,
the logographer—of whom we have some specimens remaining, and who
was alive even as late as 292 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—though he
too was a Corinthian. Either, therefore, there were two Corinthians,

an order given but not carried into effect—which latter seems to me
most probable.</p>

Two other anecdotes are recounted by Plutarch, which seem to be
of doubtful authenticity. Nikokles entreated that he might be
allowed to swallow his potion before Phokion; upon which the latter
replied—“Your request, Nikokles, is sad and mournful; but as I have
never yet refused you anything throughout my life, I grant this
also.”</p>

<p>After the four first had drunk, all except Phokion, no more
hemlock was left; upon which the jailer said that he would not
prepare any more, unless twelve drachmæ of money were given to him to
buy the material. Some hesitation took place, until Phokion asked one
of his friends to supply the money, sarcastically remarking, that it
was hard if a man could not even die <i>gratis</i> at Athens.</p>

<p>As to the first of these anecdotes—if we read, in Plato’s Phædon
(152-155), the details of the death of Sokrates,—we shall see that
death by hemlock was not caused instantaneously, but in a gradual
and painless manner; the person who had swallowed the potion being
desired to walk about for some time, until his legs grew heavy,
and then to lie down in bed, after which he gradually chilled and
became insensible, first in the extremities, next in the vital
centres. Under these circumstances, the question—which of the persons
condemned should swallow the first of the five potions—could be of
very little moment.</p>

<p>Then, as to the alleged niggardly stock of hemlock in the
Athenian prison—what would have been the alternative, if Phokion’s
friend had not furnished the twelve drachmæ? Would he have remained
in confinement, without being put to death? Certainly not; for he was
under capital sentence. Would he have been put to death by the sword
or some other unexpensive instrument? This is at variance with the
analogy of Athenian practice. If there be any truth in the story, we
must suppose that the Eleven had allotted to this jailer a stock of
hemlock (or the price thereof) really adequate to five potions, but
that he by accident or awkwardness had wasted a part of it, so that
it would have been necessary for him to supply the deficiency out of
his own pocket. From this embarrassment he was rescued by Phokion and
his friend; and Phokion’s sarcasm touches upon the strangeness of a
man being called upon to pay for his own execution.</p>

272. Mr. Fynes Clinton (following Wesseling), supplies the defect
in the text of Athenæus, so as to assign the census to the 115th
Olympiad. This conjecture <i>may</i> be right, yet the reasons for it are
not conclusive. The census may have been either in the 116th, or
in the 117th Olympiad; we have no means of determining which. The
administration of Phalerean Demetrius covers the ten years between
317 and 307 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (Fast. Hell. Append. p. 388).
</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton (ad ann. 317 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Fast. Hell.)
observes respecting the census—“The 21,000 Athenians express those
who had votes in the public assembly, or all the males above the age
of twenty years; the 10,000 μέτοικοι described also the males of
full age. When the women and children are computed, the total free
population will be about 127,660; and 400,000 slaves, added to this
total, will give about 527,660 for the total population of Attica.”
See also the Appendix to F. H. p. 390 <i>seq.</i></p>

<p>This census is a very interesting fact; but our information
respecting it is miserably scanty, and Mr. Clinton’s interpretation
of the different numbers is open to some remark. He cannot be right,
I think, in saying—“The 21,000 Athenians express those who had votes
in the assembly, <i>or</i> all the males above the age of twenty years.”
For we are expressly told, that under the administration of Demetrius
Phalereus, all persons who did not possess 1000 drachmæ were excluded
from the political franchise; and therefore a large number of males
above the age of twenty years would have no vote in the assembly.
Since the two categories are not coincident, then, to which shall
we apply the number 21,000? To those who had votes? Or to the total
number of free citizens, voting or not voting, above the age of
twenty? The public assembly, during the administration of Demetrius
Phalereus, appears to have been of little moment or efficacy; so that
a distinct record, of the number of persons entitled to vote in it,
is not likely to have been sought.</p>

<p>Then again, Mr. Clinton interprets the three numbers given, upon
two principles totally distinct. The two first numbers (citizens and
metics), he considers to designate only males of full age; the third
number, of οἰκέται, he considers to include both sexes and all ages.
</p>

<p>This is a conjecture which I think very doubtful, in the absence
of farther knowledge. It implies that the enumerators take account
of the <i>slave</i> women and children—but that they take no account of
the <i>free</i> women and children, wives and families of the citizens
and metics. The number of the free women and children are wholly
unrecorded, on Mr. Clinton’s supposition. Now if, for the purposes
of the census, it was necessary to enumerate the <i>slave</i> women and
children—it surely would be not less necessary to enumerate the
<i>free</i> women and children.</p>

<p>The word οἰκέται sometimes means, not slaves only, but the
inmates of a family generally—free as well as slave. If such be
its meaning here (which however there is not evidence enough to
affirm), we eliminate the difficulty of supposing the slave women and
children to be enumerated—and the free women and children <i>not</i> to be
enumerated.</p>

<p>We should be able to reason more confidently, if we knew the
purpose for which the census had been taken—whether with a view to
military or political measures—to finance and taxation—or to the
question of subsistence and importation of foreign corn (see Mr.
Clinton’s Fast. H. ad ann. 444 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, about
another census taken in reference to imported corn).</p>

842-852. Lykurgus at his death (about 324 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>)
left three sons, who are said, shortly after his death, to have
been prosecuted by Menesæchmus, and put in prison (“handed over to
the Eleven”). But Thrasykles, supported by Demokles, stood forward
on their behalf; and Demosthenes, then in banishment at Trœzen,
wrote emphatic remonstrances to the Athenians against such unworthy
treatment of the sons of a distinguished patriot. Accordingly the
Athenians soon repented and released them.</p>

<p>This is what we find stated in Plutarch, Vit. X. Oratt. p. 842.
The third of the so-called Demosthenic Epistles purports to be the
letter written on this subject by Demosthenes.</p>

<p>The harsh treatment of the sons of Lykurgus (whatever it may have
amounted to, and whatever may have been its ground) certainly did not
last long; for in the next page of the very same Plutarchian life
(p. 843), an account is given of the family of Lykurgus, which was
ancient and sacerdotal; and it is there stated that his sons after
his death fully sustained the dignified position of the family.</p>

<p>On what ground they were accused, we cannot make out. According
to the Demosthenic epistle (which epistles I have before stated that
I do not believe to be authentic), it was upon some allegation,
which, if valid at all, ought to have been urged against Lykurgus
himself during his life (p. 1477, 1478); but Lykurgus had been always
honorably acquitted, and always held thoroughly estimable, up to the
day of his death (p. 1475).</p>

<p>Demochares might find (besides the persons named in Athenæ.

Isokrates who had been atrocious and sanguinary tyrants in their
native cities—see the case of Klearchus of Herakleia, Memnon ap.
Photium, Cod. 224. cap. 1. Chion and Leonides, the two young citizens
who slew Klearchus, and who perished in endeavoring to liberate their
country—were also pupils of Plato (Justin, xvi. 5). In fact, aspiring
youths, of all varieties of purpose, were likely to seek this mode
of improvement. (Alexander the Great, too, the very impersonation of
subduing force, had been the pupil of Aristotle).</p>

<p id="Footnote_899"><span class="label"><a

Plutarch (Demetr. 24); but it seems not in harmony with the recital
of the honorary decree, passed in 272 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
after the death of Demochares, commemorating his merits by a statue,
etc. (Plutarch, Vit. X. Oratt. p. 850). It is there recited that
Demochares rendered services to Athens (fortifying and arming the
city, concluding peace and alliance with the Bœotians, etc.) ἐπὶ τοῦ
τετραετοῦς πολέμου, ἀνθ᾽ ὧν ἐξέπεσεν ὑπὸ τῶν καταλυσάντων τὸν δῆμον.
Οἱ καταλύσαντες τὸν δῆμον cannot mean either Demetrius Poliorketes,
or Stratokles. Moreover, we cannot determine when the “four years’
war”, or the alliance with the Bœotians, occurred. Neither the
discussion of Mr. Clinton (Fast. H. 302 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
and Append. p. 380), nor the different hypothesis of Droysen, are
satisfactory on this point—see Carl Müller’s discussion on the
fragments of Demochares, Fragm. Hist. Gr. v. ii. p. 446.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_900"><span class="label"><a

αὑτὸν ἄνοπλον τοῖς ἱερεῦσι, καὶ πρὸ τῆς ὡρισμένης ἡμέρας μυηθεὶς,
ἀνέζευξεν ἐκ τῶν Ἀθηνῶν.</p>

<p>The account of this transaction in the text is taken from
Diodorus, and is a simple one; a vote was passed granting special
license to Demetrius, to receive the mysteries at once, though it was
not the appointed season.</p>

<p>Plutarch (Demetr. 26) superadds other circumstances, several of
which have the appearance of jest rather than reality. Pythodôrus
the Daduch or Torch-bearer of the Mysteries stood alone in his
protest against any celebration of the ceremony out of time: this is
doubtless very credible. Then (according to Plutarch) the Athenians
passed decrees, on the proposition of Stratokles, that the month
Munychion should be called Anthesterion. This having been done, the
Lesser Mysteries were celebrated, in which Demetrius was initiated.
Next, the Athenians passed another decree, to the effect, that the
month Munychion should be called Boêdromion—after which, the Greater
Mysteries (which belonged to the latter month) were forthwith
celebrated. The comic writer Philippides said of Stratokles, that he
had compressed the whole year into a single month.</p>

<p>This statement of Plutarch has very much the air of a caricature,
by Philippides or some other witty man, of the simple decree
mentioned by Diodorus—a special license to Demetrius to be initiated
out of season. Compare another passage of Philippides against
Stratokles (Plutarch, Demetr. 12).</p>

the foundation of the important city of Demetrias on the Gulf of
Magnesia, which afterwards became one of the great strongholds of the
Macedonian ascendency in Greece (Strabo, ix. p. 436-443, in which
latter passage, the reference to Hieronymus of Kardia seems to prove
that that historian gave a full description of Demetrias and its
foundation). See about Demetrias, Mannert, Geogr. v. Griech. vii. p.

months earlier than the reality. It is clear from Diodorus, (and
indeed from Mr. Clinton’s own admission) that winter-quarters in Asia
intervened between the departure of Demetrius from Athens in or soon
after April 301 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and the battle of Ipsus.
Moreover Demetrius, immediately after leaving Athens, carried on many
operations against Kassander in Thessaly, before crossing over to

<p id="Footnote_922"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_922">[922]</a></span> A curious proof how fully
Olympias was queen of Epirus is preserved in the fragments (recently
published by Mr. Babington) of the oration of Hyperides in defence
of Euxenippus, p. 12. The Athenians, in obedience to an oracular
mandate from the Dodonæan Zeus, had sent to Dodona a solemn embassy
for sacrifice, and had dressed and adorned the statue of Diônê
there situated. Olympias addressed a despatch to the Athenians,
reproving them for this as a trespass upon her dominions—ὑπὲρ
τούτων ὑμῖν τὰ ἐγκλήματα ἦλθε παρ᾽ Ὀλυμπιάδος ἐν ταῖς ἐπιστολαῖς,
ὡς <span class="gesperrt">ἡ χώρα εἴη ἡ Μολοσσία αὐτῆς</span>, ἐν
ᾗ τὸ ἱερόν ἐστιν· οὔκουν προσῆκεν ἡμᾶς τῶν ἐκεῖ οὐδὲ ἓν κινεῖν.
Olympias took a high and insolent tone in this letter (τὰς <span
class="gesperrt">τραγῳδίας</span> αὐτῆς καὶ τὰς κατηγορίας, etc.)</p>

<p>The date of this oration is at some period during the life of
Alexander the Great—but cannot be more precisely ascertained. After
the death of Alexander, Olympias passed much time in Epirus, where
she thought herself more secure from the enmity of Antipater (Diodor.
xviii. 49).</p>

<p>Dodona had been one of the most ancient places of pilgrimage
for the Hellenic race—especially for the Athenians. The order
here addressed to them,—that they should abstain from religious
manifestations at this sanctuary—is a remarkable proof of the growing
encroachments on free Hellenism; the more so, as Olympias sent
offerings to temples at Athens when she chose and without asking
permission—we learn this from the same fragment of Hyperides.</p>

<p>That Agathokles, on leaving Syracuse, went to the Carthaginians,
appears to be implied in the words of Diodorus, c. 6—τοὺς αὐτῷ
πρότερον συμπορευθέντας <span class="gesperrt">πρὸς</span>
Καρχηδονίους (see Wesseling’s note on the translation of <span
class="gesperrt">πρὸς</span>). This fact is noticed merely
incidentally, in the confused narrative of Diodorus; but it brings
him to a certain extent into harmony with Justin (xxii. 2),
who insists much on the combination between Agathokles and the
Carthaginians, as one of the main helps whereby he was enabled to
seize the supreme power.</p>

<p id="Footnote_931"><span class="label"><a

best which I can make out from Diodorus (xix. 5), Justin (xxii.

by Agathokles—παραχθεὶς εἰς τὸ τῆς Δήμητρος ἱερὸν ὑπὸ τῶν πολιτῶν,
ὤμοσε μηδὲν ἐναντιωθήσεσθαι τῇ δημοκρατίᾳ—“Tunc Hamilcari expositis
ignibus Cereris tactisque in obsequia Pœnorum jurat.” “Jurare in
obsequia Pœnorum” can hardly be taken to mean that Syracuse was to
become subject to Carthage; there was nothing antecedent to justify
such a proceeding, nor does anything follow in the sequel which
implies it.</p>

<p>Compare also the speech which Justin puts into the mouth of
Bomilkar when executed for treason by the Carthaginians—“objectans
illis (Carthaginiensibus) in Hamilcarem patruum suum tacita
suffragia, quod Agathoclem <i>sociam illis facere, quam hostem,
maluerit</i>” (xxii. 7). This points to previous collusion between
Hamilkar and Agathokles.</p>

the landing of Scipio in the Carthaginian territory in the latter
years of the second Punic war, says, “Emporia ut peterent,
gubernatoribus edixit. Fertilissimus ager, eoque abundans omnium
copiâ rerum est regio, et imbelles (quod plerumque in uberi agro

<p>About the harshness of the Carthaginian rule over their African
subjects, see Diodor. xv. 77; Polyb. i. 72. In reference to the
above passage of Polybius, however, we ought to keep in mind—That
in describing this harshness, he speaks with <i>express and exclusive
reference</i> to the conduct of the Carthaginians towards their subjects
during the first Punic war (against Rome), when the Carthaginians
themselves were hard pressed by the Romans and required everything
that they could lay hands upon for self-defence. This passage of
Polybius has been sometimes cited as if it attested the <i>ordinary</i>
character and measure of Carthaginian dominion; which is contrary to
the intention of the author.</p>

Polybius, i. 29, where he describes the first invasion of the
Carthaginian territory by the Roman consul Regulus. Tunês was 120
stadia or about fourteen miles south-east of Carthage (Polyb. i.
67). The Tab. Peuting. reckons it only ten miles. It was made the
central place for hostile operations against Carthage both by Regulus
in the first Punic war (Polyb. i. 30),—by Matho and Spendius, in
the rebellion of the mercenary soldiers and native Africans against
Carthage, which followed on the close of the first Punic war (Polyb.
i. 73)—and by the revolted Libyans in 396 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
(Diodor. xiv. 77).</p>

<p>Diodorus places Tunês at the distance of 2000 stadia from
Carthage, which must undoubtedly be a mistake. He calls it <i>White
Tunês</i>; an epithet drawn from the chalk cliffs adjoining.</p>

<p>The amount of native or citizen-force given here by Diodorus
(40,000 foot and 1000 horse) seems very great. Our data for
appreciating it however are lamentably scanty; and we ought to
expect a large total. The population of Carthage is said to have
been 700,000 souls; even when it was besieged by the Romans in
the third Punic war, and when its power was prodigiously lessened
(Strabo, xvii. p. 833). Its military magazines, even in that reduced
condition, were enormous,—as they stood immediately previous to their
being given up to the Romans, under the treacherous delusions held
out by Rome.</p>

<p>In this remarkable passage (the more remarkable because so little
information concerning Carthaginian antiquity has reached us), one
clause is not perfectly clear, respecting the three hundred who are
said to have voluntarily <i>given themselves up</i>. Diodorus means (I
apprehend) as Eusebius understood it, that these were fathers who
gave up <i>their children</i> (not themselves) to be sacrificed. The
victims here mentioned as sacrificed to Kronus were children, not
adults (compare Diodor. xiii. 86): nothing is here said about adult
victims. Wesseling in his note adheres to the literal meaning of the
words, dissenting from Eusebius: but I think that the literal meaning
is less in harmony with the general tenor of the paragraph. Instances
of self-devotion, by persons torn with remorse, are indeed mentioned:
see the case of Imilkon, Diodor. xiv. 76; Justin, xix. 3.</p>

<p>We read in the Fragment of Ennius—“Pœni sunt soliti suos
sacrificare puellos:” see the chapter iv. of Münter’s work, Religion

<p id="Footnote_964"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_964">[964]</a></span> Diodor. xx. 17. The incident
here recounted by Diodorus is curious, but quite distinct and
intelligible. He had good authorities before him in his history of
Agathokles. If true, it affords an evidence for determining, within
some limits, the site of the ancient Adrumetum, which Mannert and
Shaw place at Herkla— while Forbiger and Dr. Barth put it near the
site of the modern port called Susa, still more to the southward, and
at a prodigious distance from Tunis. Other anthem have placed it at
Hamamat, more to the northward than Herkla, and nearer to Tunis.</p>

<p>Of these three sites, Hamamat is the only one which will consist
with the narrative of Diodorus. Both the others are too distant.
Hamamat is about forty-eight English miles from Tunis (see Barth, p.
184, with his note). This is as great a distance (if not too great)
as can possibly be admitted; both Herkla and Susa are very much more
distant, and therefore out of the question.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the other evidence known to us tends apparently to
place Adrumetum at Susa, and not at Hamamat (see Barth, p. 142-154;
Forbiger, Handb. Geog. p. 845). It is therefore probable that the
narrative of Diodorus is not true, or must apply to some other
place on the coast (possibly Neapolis, the modern Nabel) taken by
Agathokles, and not to Adrumetum.</p>

(c. 30) talks of Aspis as founded by the <i>Siculi</i>. Aspis (called by
the Romans Clypea), being on the eastern side of Cape Bon, was more
convenient for communication with Sicily than either Carthage, or
Tunis, or any part of the Gulf of Carthage, which was on the western
side of Cape Bon. To get round that headland is, even at the present
day, a difficult and uncertain enterprise for navigators: see the
remarks of Dr. Barth, founded partly on his own personal experience
(Wanderungen auf den Küstenländern des Mittelmeeres, i. p. 196).
A ship coming from Sicily to Aspis was not under the necessity of
getting round the headland.</p>

<p>In the case of Agathokles, there was a further reason for
establishing his maritime position at Aspis. The Carthaginian fleet
was superior to him at sea; accordingly they could easily interrupt
his maritime communication from Sicily with Tunis, or with any point
in the Gulf of Carthage. But it was not so easy for them to watch the
coast at Aspis; for in order to do this, they must get from the Gulf
round to Cape Bon.</p>

consul Regulus, when he invaded Africa during the first Punic war,
is said to have acquired, either by capture or voluntary adhesion,
two hundred dependent cities of Carthage (Appian, Punica, c. 3).
Respecting the prodigious number of towns in Northern Africa, see the
very learned and instructive work of Mövers, Die Phönikier, vol. ii.
p. 454 <i>seqq.</i> Even at the commencement of the third Punic war, when
Carthage was so much reduced in power, she had still three hundred
cities in Libya (Strabo, xvii. p. 833). It must be confessed that the
name cities or towns (πόλεις) was used by some authors very vaguely.
Thus Posidonius ridiculed the affirmation of Polybius (Strabo, iii.
p. 162), that Tiberius Gracchus had destroyed three hundred πόλεις of
the Celtiberians; Strabo censures others who spoke of one thousand
πόλεις of the Iberians. Such a number could only be made good by
including large κῶμαι.</p>

<p id="Footnote_997"><span class="label"><a

Strabo (xvii. p. 826), we learn this fact—that Ophellas had surveyed
the whole coast of Northern Africa, to the straits of Gibraltar,
and round the old Phenician settlements on the western coast of
modern Morocco. Some eminent critics (Grosskurd among them) reject
the reading in Strabo—ἀπὸ τοῦ Ὀφέλα (or Ὀφέλλα) περιπλοῦ, which is
sustained by a very great preponderance of MSS. But I do not feel the
force of their reasons; and the reading which they would substitute
has nothing to recommend it. In my judgment, Ophellas, ruling in
the Kyrenaica and indulging aspirations towards conquest westward,
was a man both likely to order, and competent to bring about, an
examination of the North African coast. The knowledge of this fact
may have induced Agathokles to apply to him.</p>

<p id="Footnote_1009"><a href="#FNanchor_1009"><span
class="label">[1009]</span></a> Polybius (i. 82) expressly
states that the inhabitants of Utica and of Hippu-Akra (a little
further to the west than Utica), remained faithful to Carthage
throughout the hostilities carried on by Agathokles. This enables
us to correct the passage wherein Diodorus describes the attack
of Agathokles upon Utica (xx. 54)—ἐπὶ μὲν Ἰτυκαίους ἐστράτευσεν
<span class="gesperrt">ἀφεστηκότας</span>, ἄφνω δὲ αὐτῶν τῇ πόλει
προσπεσών, etc. The word <span class="gesperrt">ἀφεστηκότας</span>
here is perplexing. It must mean that the Uticans had revolted <i>from
Agathokles</i>; yet Diodorus has not before said a word about the
Uticans, nor reported that they had either joined Agathokles, or been
conquered by him. Everything that Diodorus has reported hitherto
about Agathokles, relates to operations among the towns east or
south-east of Carthage.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the passage ought to stand—ἐπὶ μὲν
Ἰτυκαίους ἐστράτευσεν <span class="gesperrt">οὐκ ἀφεστηκότας</span>,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from Carthage; which introduces consistency into the
narrative of Diodorus himself, while it brings him into harmony with
Polybius.</p>

Hippu-Akra (otherwise called Hippo-Zarytus, near the Promontorium
Pulchrum, the northernmost point of Africa), Agathokles is said to
have got the better in a naval battle—ναυμαχία περιγενόμενος. This
implies that he must have got a fleet superior to the Carthaginians
even in their own gulf; perhaps ships seized at Utica.</p>

Neither Justin (xxiii. 2) nor Trogus before him, (as it seems from

<p id="Footnote_1049"><a href="#FNanchor_1049"><span

Agathokles, though cruel in the extreme at the beginning of his
career, and in the establishment of his power, yet became the mildest
of men after his power was once established. The latter half of this
statement is contradicted by all the particular facts which we know
respecting Agathokles.</p>

<p>As to Timæus the historian, indeed (who had been banished from
Sicily by Agathokles, and who wrote the history of the latter in
five books), Polybius had good reason to censure him, as being
unmeasured in his abuse of Agathokles. For Timæus not only recounted
of Agathokles numerous acts of nefarious cruelty—acts of course
essentially public, and therefore capable of being known—but also
told much scandal about his private habits, and represented him
(which is still more absurd) as a man vulgar and despicable in point
of ability. See the Fragments of Timæus ap. Histor. Græc. ed. Didot.
Frag. 144-150.</p>

preceding pages, have been copied from Diodorus; who had as good
authorities before him as Polybius possessed. Diodorus does not copy
the history of Agathokles from Timæus; on the contrary, he censures
Timæus for his exaggerated acrimony and injustice towards Agathokles,
in terms not less forcibly than those which Polybius employs (xxi.
Fragm. p. 279). Diodorus cites Timæus by name, occasionally and in
particular instances: but he evidently did not borrow from that
author the main stream of his narrative. He seems to have had
before him other authorities—among them some highly favorable to
Agathokles—the Syracusan Kallias—and Antander, brother of Agathokles
(xxi. p. 278-282).</p>

Personally, Hiero seems to have deserved this praise—and to
have deserved yet more praise for his mild and prudent internal

secondary in the great struggle between Rome and Carthage for the
mastery of Sicily.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered that Ephorus was a native of the Asiatic

Massalia. The Massaliots never forgot or broke off their connection

communicate.</p>

2. Περὶ Ὠκεανοῦ. His statements were greatly esteemed, and often
followed, by Eratosthenes; partially followed by Hipparchus; harshly
judged by Polybius, whom Strabo in the main follows. Even by those
who judge him most severely, Pytheas is admitted to have been a
good mathematician and astronomer (Strabo, iv. p. 201)—and to have
travelled extensively in person. Like Herodotus, he must have been
forced to report a great deal on hearsay; and all that he could do
was to report the best hearsay information which reached him. It is
evident that his writings made an epoch in geographical inquiries;
though they doubtless contained numerous inaccuracies. See a fair
estimate of Pytheas in Mannert, Geog. der Gr. und Römer, Introd. i.

<p>The Massaliotic Codex of Homer, possessed and consulted among

celebrity of Massalia as a place of Grecian literature and study (in
which character it competed with Athens towards the commencement of

century before the Christian era.</p>

Isokrates, Epist. vii.</p>

<p>It is here that the fragments of Memnon, as abstracted by Photius
(Cod. 224), begin. Photius had seen only eight books of Memnon’s
History of Herakleia (Books ix.-xvi. inclusive); neither the first
eight books (see the end of his Excerpta from Memnon), nor those
after the sixteenth, had come under his view. This is greatly to be
regretted, as we are thus shut out from the knowledge of Heraklean
affairs anterior to Klearchus.</p>

<p>It happens, not unfrequently, with Photius, that he does not
possess an entire work, but only parts of it; this is a curious
fact, in reference to the libraries of the ninth century <span
class="smcap">A.&nbsp;D.</span></p>

<p>The fragments of Memnon are collected out of Photius, together
with those of Nymphis and other Herakleotic historians, and
illustrated with useful notes and citations, in the edition of
Orelli; as well as by K. Müller, in Didot’s Fragm. Hist. Græc. tom.
iii. p. 525. Memnon carried his history down to the time of Julius
Cæsar, and appears to have lived shortly after the Christian era.
Nymphis (whom he probably copied) was much older; having lived
seemingly from about 300-230 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (see the few
Fragmenta remaining from him, in the same work, iii. p. 12). The work
of the Herakleotic author Herodôrus seems to have been altogether
upon legendary matter (see Fragm. in the same work, ii. p. 27). He
was half a century earlier than Nymphis.</p>

<p>In the Antigonid dynasty of Macedonia, we read that Demetrius,
son of Antigonus Gonatas, died leaving his son Philip a boy.
Antigonus called Doson, younger brother of Demetrius, assumed the
regency on behalf of Philip; he married the widow of Demetrius,
and had children by her; but he was so anxious to guard Philip’s
succession against all chance of being disturbed, that he refused to
bring up his own children—Ὁ δὲ παιδῶν γενομένων ἐκ τῆς Χρυσηΐδος,

<p>In the Greek and Roman world, the father was generally considered

mentioned. His complaints run through the five books of the Tristia,
and the four books of Epistolæ ex Ponto (Trist. v. 10, 15).</p>

<p>Ovid dwells especially upon the fact that there was more of
barbaric than of Hellenic speech at Tomi—“Graiaque quod Getico victa
loquela sono est” (Trist. v. 2, 68). Woollen clothing, and the
practice of spinning and weaving by the free women of the family,
were among the most familiar circumstances of Grecian life; the
absence of these feminine arts, and the use of skins or leather for
clothing, were notable departures from Grecian habits (Ex Ponto, iii.
8):—</p>

<p id="Footnote_1116"><a href="#FNanchor_1116"><span

Inscr. Græc. part xi. p. 121 <i>seq.</i>—is among the most interesting
in that noble collection. It records a vote of public gratitude
and honor to a citizen of Olbia named Protogenes, and recites the
valuable services which he as well as his father had rendered to
the city. It thus describes the numerous situations of difficulty
and danger from which he had contributed to extricate them. A
vivid picture is presented to us of the distress of the city. The
introduction prefixed by Boeckh (p. 86-89) is also very instructive.
</p>

<p>Olbia is often spoken of by the name of <i>Borysthenes</i>, which name
was given to it by foreigners, but not recognized by the citizens.
Nor was it even situated on the Borysthenes river; but on the right
or western bank of the Hypanis (Bug) river; not far from the modern
Oczakoff.</p>

<p>The date of the above Inscription is not specified, and has
been differently determined by various critics. Niebuhr assigns it
(Untersuchungen über die Skythen, etc. in his Kleine Schriften, p.
387) to a time near the close of the second Punic war. Boeckh also
believes that it is not much after that epoch. The terror inspired
by the Gauls, even to other barbarians, appears to suit the second
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> better than it suits a later
period.</p>

<p>The Inscription No. 2059 attests the great number of strangers
resident at Olbia; strangers from eighteen different cities, of which
the most remote is Miletus, the mother-city of Olbia.</p>

<p>The representation given by Dion of the youthful citizen of
Olbia—Kallistratus—with whom he conversed, is curious as a picture
of Greek manners in this remote land; a youth of eighteen years of
age, with genuine Ionic features, and conspicuous for his beauty
(εἶχε πολλοὺς ἐραστάς) a zealot for literature and philosophy, but
especially for Homer; clothed in the costume of the place, suited for
riding—the long leather trowsers, and short black cloak; constantly
on horseback for defence of the town, and celebrated as a warrior
even at that early age, having already killed or made prisoners
several Sarmatians (p. 77).</p>

<p>In the Memorabilia of Xenophon (ii. 1, 10). Sokrates cites
the Scythians as an example of ruling people, and the Mæotæ as an
example of subjects. Probably this refers to the position of the
Bosporanic Greeks, who paid tribute to the Scythians, but ruled over
the Mæotæ. The name <i>Mæotæ</i> seems confined to tribes on the Asiatic
side of the Palus Mæotis; while the Scythians were on the European
side of that sea. Sokrates and the Athenians had good means of being
informed about the situation of the Bosporani and their neighbors on
both sides. See K. Neumann, die Hellenen im Skythenlande, b. ii. p.

military operations (as far as we can pretend to make it out from
the brief and superficial narrative of Diodorus), seems to have been
on the European side of Bosporus; somewhere between the Borysthenes
river and the Isthmus of Perekop, in the territory called by
Herodotus <i>Hylæa</i>. This is Niebuhr’s opinion, which I think more
probable than that of Boeckh, who supposes the operations to have
occurred on the Asiatic territory of Bosporus. So far I concur with
Niebuhr; but his reasons for placing Dromichætes king of the Getæ
(the victor over Lysimachus), east of the Borysthenes, are noway
satisfactory.</p>

<p>The mention by Diodorus of a wooden fortress, surrounded by
morass and forest, is curious, and may be illustrated by the
description in Herodotus (iv. 108) of the city of the Budini. This
habit of building towns and fortifications of wood, prevailed among
the Slavonic population in Russia and Poland until far down in the
middle ages. See Paul Joseph Schaffarik, Slavische Alterhümer, in the

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_1146"><a href="#FNanchor_1146"><span
class="label">[1146]</span></a> An account of the recent discoveries
near Kertch or Pantikapæum, will be found in Dubois de Montpéreux,
Voyage dans le Caucase, vol. v. p. 135 <i>seqq.</i>; and in Neumann, Die
Hellenen im Skythenlande, pp. 483-533. The last-mentioned work is
peculiarly copious and instructive; relating what has been done since
Dubois’s travels, and containing abundant information derived from
the recent memoirs of the St. Petersburg Literary Societies.</p>

<p>The local and special type, which shows itself so much on
these works of art, justifies the inference that they were not
brought from other Grecian cities, but executed by Grecian artists
resident at Pantikapæum (p. 507). Two marble statues, a man and
a woman, both larger than life, exhumed in 1850, are spoken of
with peculiar admiration (p. 491). Coins of the third and fourth
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> have been found in several (p.
494, 495). A great number of the so-called Etruscan vases have also
been discovered, probably fabricated from a species of clay still
existing in the neighborhood: the figures on these vases are often
excellent, with designs and scenes of every description, religious,
festal, warlike, domestic (p. 522). Many of the sarcophagi are
richly ornamented with carvings, in wood, ivory, etc; some admirably
executed (p. 521).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the belief prevails, and has long prevailed,
among the neighboring population, that these tumuli contain hidden
treasures. One of the most striking among them—called the Kul-Obo—was
opened in 1830 by the Russian authorities. After great pains and
trouble, the means of entrance were discovered, and the interior
chamber was reached. It was the richest that had ever been opened;
being found to contain some splendid golden ornaments, as well as
many other relics. The Russian officers placed a guard to prevent
any one from entering it; but the cupidity of the population of
Kertch was so inflamed by the report of the expected treasure being
discovered, that they forced the guard, broke into the interior, and
pillaged most of the contents (p. 509). The Russian authorities have
been generally anxious for the preservation and gradual excavation of
these monuments, but have had to contend against repugnance and even
rapacity on the part of the people near.</p>

<p>Dubois de Montpéreux gives an interesting description of the
opening of these tumuli near Kertch—especially of the Kul-Obo, the
richest of all, which he conceives to have belonged to one of the
Spartokid kings, and the decorations of which were the product of
Hellenic art:—</p>

<p>“Si l’on a enterré (he observes) un roi entouré d’un luxe
Scythique, ce sont des Græcs et des artistes de cette nation qui ont
travaillé à ses funerailles” (Voyage autour du Caucase, pp. 195, 213,
227). Pantikapæum and Phanagoria (he says) “se reconnoissent de loin
à la foule de leurs tumulus” (p. 137).</p>
